In this lesson you‚Äôll learn that you don‚Äôt have to be an expert to design your ‚ÄúGoogle Business Card‚Äù to look attractive and convincing (and you‚Äôll understand how this course delivers on that promise üôÇ Importantly, nothing in this course is too technical or too difficult for any marketer to implement.

This course also covers the most accessible tips, tricks, and techniques you need for quickly and simply optimising your Brand SERP.

"For bricks and mortar stores, their Google Business Profile is crucial when it comes to customer needs because it‚Äôs the first thing they see when they search the company name.

On the other hand, Rich Elements on the left rail of the Brand SERP gives an overview of whether your business is active or not, how your audience interacts with you, and how you deliver your service.

On Aram Store‚Äôs Brand SERP, the Right Rail is much longer than the Left Rail. They manage their GBP well, but since it‚Äôs a local furniture store, I thought they might add some SERP Features like Image Boxes and Video Boxes to even up the lengths of the left and right rails‚Ä¶ and also make their Brand SERP even more attractive to prospective clients.

The Twitter profile which can become Twitter Boxes is also a groovy option but it still needs a little more push to climb up the first page

Watch until the end!

"At Kalicube we do a lot of work with clients to help them optimise their Brand SERP and manage their Knowledge Panel. These practical case studies highlight the benefits, the techniques and strategies of different aspects of this work. We start by identifying the problems and challenges that each case has.

These Brand SERP and Knowledge Panel Case Studies case studies include Brand SERP and Knowledge Panel optimisation wins shared with us by people who succeeded on their own after reading Jason Barnard‚Äôs book (The Fundamentals of Brand SERPs for Business), after taking one of the Brand SERP courses in the Kalicube Academy, or by using the Kalicube Pro SaaS Platform.

There are also some case studies from our own experiments at Kalicube ‚Äì we run thousands of experiments every year to develop a toolset of techniques and strategies to take every opportunity offered by Brand SERPs and Knowledge Panels, and also resolve any problem you might encounter with them."
"Explanation of the Timeline for Triggering a Knowledge Panel for a Person or a Company

A Knowledge Panel is Google's stamp of authority for your entity (person or company).

An information-rich, accurate and impressive Knowledge Panel on the Brand SERP Right Rail (facts according to Google).

Protip:

Google is currently most reliable insight into each individual person or company and their digital strategy that Kalicube can leverage to power 10x.

Becoming THE #1 recognised online authority in your niche should be your #1 focus. And the Google search result for your name is the fulcrum today.

Whatever the future, Google, Bing, ChatGPT, Facebook, YouTube ...
all feed from the same source: your own presentation of yourself on the web.

As seen below, the Kalicube Process has helped our clients to trigger, merge, and manage their entities.


The Kalicube Process is simple but geeky. You can get started quickly with this three-step process:

Entity Home: Identify your Entity Home (i.e. the website where the named entity ‚Äúresides‚Äù online),

Corroboration: Get significant corroboration (aka PR campaign),

Signposting: Create an infinite self-confirming loop (by linking from the Entity Home to the corroboration and back).

Learning how to trigger a Knowledge Panel also translates into job offers. Knowledge Panel management continues to be our best-selling service, and our resources have also helped our subscribers build careers.


Where do you learn the Kalicube Process for triggering and managing a Knowledge Panel?

It depends on your learning style. You can look for the articles we publish on the web (Kalicube.com resources), watch tutorials on the Kalicube YouTube channel, use the checklist we provide for free, or enrol in the Kalicube Academy.

However, there are disadvantages that you have to face with the prior options. First, it's difficult to concentrate while watching YouTube videos; second, the long hours spent staring and jumping from article to article.

With the Kalicube process, developed by Jason Barnard, you won't waste your valuable time trying to figure out what to do next. With intermediate to expert SEO experience, you can quickly progress and acquire the skills needed to work on a Knowledge Panel.


Pro-tip: Mistakes in choosing the triggering process can have fatal consequences in the future. Relying on processes that use a pseudo Wikipedia site to trick Google is a pitfall, this will have fatal consequences in the future and cost more to fix.

Why Kalicube Academy?

The course consists of 21 lessons and over 5 hours of video. Unlike many other courses you find online, not a single minute of Kalicube Academy's lessons is ad-libbed.

We script every second of every lesson in the Academy to ensure that every sentence provides valuable insight and not one minute of your time is wasted.

Extremely high production values, focussed content, practical advice, amazing supporting visuals and demonstrative screencasts make all the courses in the Kalicube Academy the ‚ÄúHollywood production‚Äù of online courses :)

While we love the phrase, ‚ÄúWe are building the plane as we fly‚Äù, where we conduct numerous experiments on our own entities, Jason has 15 years of experience in this field already, so you can guarantee that your entity is safe and learning from experienced and capable hands.

So what are you waiting for? Start the Knowledge Panel course, plan and dedicate time for this process, and think about how your authority and credibility will change in the eyes of your audience and your industry when you get ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äôs stamp of approval‚Äù."
