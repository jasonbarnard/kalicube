How Can Aram Store Trigger Rich Elements for Their Short Left Rail?	"For bricks and mortar stores, their Google Business Profile is crucial when it comes to customer needs because it‚Äôs the first thing they see when they search the company name.

On the other hand, Rich Elements on the left rail of the Brand SERP gives an overview of whether your business is active or not, how your audience interacts with you, and how you deliver your service.

On Aram Store‚Äôs Brand SERP, the Right Rail is much longer than the Left Rail. They manage their GBP well, but since it‚Äôs a local furniture store, I thought they might add some SERP Features like Image Boxes and Video Boxes to even up the lengths of the left and right rails‚Ä¶ and also make their Brand SERP even more attractive to prospective clients.

The Twitter profile which can become Twitter Boxes is also a groovy option but it still needs a little more push to climb up the first page

Watch until the end!

Kalicube‚Äôs #DailyBrandSERP  December 18th 2021 presented by the Brand SERP Guy, Jason Barnard.

Transcript:
Hi and welcome, I‚Äôm Jason Barnard. I‚Äôm the Brand SERP Guy and today, we‚Äôre looking at the Brand SERP for Aram Store, which is a furniture store in the UK in London.

Now, if you look over here on the left-hand side, we‚Äôve got these Vertical Rich Sitelinks in the UK now, which is pretty cool. I‚Äôm starting to like them more and more.

And as we scroll down, we see Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. And that will come into play in a moment because if we look on the right-hand side, they‚Äôve got an absolutely beautiful Google Business Profile, lots of reviews, they‚Äôve added their products, they‚Äôve got questions & answers, they‚Äôve got more reviews, they‚Äôve got texts from their own store, plus some products and their social profiles. And it‚Äôs actually longer than the left-hand rail.

Now, why am I pointing that out? It‚Äôs because they‚Äôre doing a really great job on their Google Business Profile and there aren‚Äôt any Rich Elements on the left-hand side, and they could potentially given that they‚Äôre a furniture store have Image Boxes or perhaps Video Boxes.

I couldn‚Äôt find a YouTube channel, but I do see they‚Äôre quite active on Instagram and Facebook. And then if I look over on to page two, we can see that Twitter here is hovering on the brink of coming on to that first page with the potential for Twitter boxes if they can push it up to the top of the first page, get it active, get people engaging.

And they could fill this left-hand rail with more rich information, Images, Videos, Twitter Boxes, to match up to that amazing right-hand side that they‚Äôve got already.

Thank you very much and I‚Äôll see you soon."
Starting as a Musician in a Punk Folk Group, Jason Barnard‚Äôs Life Is About Doing What He Loves and Making the World a Slightly Better Place	"The way you put it sounds like a really interesting story. And we can add to that now and say, I‚Äôm now in Oxford using Oxford University libraries to write and research a book. And a lot of my life has just been about what‚Äôs a fun idea? And I don‚Äôt need to be at Oxford, I don‚Äôt need to use the libraries, but it‚Äôs a lot of fun and it makes me feel slightly more intelligent, as I said earlier on. And the whole process of my life has been what do I really want to do? What do I feel would be nourishing for me as a human being? And what would make the world a slightly better place? 

[00:02:59] The Brand SERP Guy (Jason Barnard): And playing in a punk folk group, obviously punk folk is quite aggressive, but it made a lot of people happy. We ended up with quite big crowds. We‚Äôd get 2-500 people. And making people happy, having a good time at a gig was really, really, really positive for me, and I enjoyed it immensely. And then being a blue dog in a cartoon was for small children. So, it was all about educating small children between the ages of 3 and 6, teaching them about the world through the eyes and the actions of a blue dog and a yellow koala in a cartoon."
Jason Barnard Then Got Into the Internet by Managing a Website for His Cartoon Characters, Which Led Him to the World of Digital Marketing	"And I actually got into the internet through the blue dog and the yellow koala, because we had a website that was phenomenally successful. By 2007, it was the 10,000th biggest site in the world, and it was just for kids. And we were competing with PBS and Disney and the BBC. It was really exciting. And it was 100 million page views a month, it was 5 million visits a month, it was huge. And what was great is we were living on a tropical island in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Madagascar with a team of 4 people running this site. And I was being a blue dog and my wife was being a yellow koala. What a lot of fun that was. 

[00:04:15] The Brand SERP Guy (Jason Barnard): And so, that then led me to the new career, which was when I pivoted from that and became a digital marketer. If you searched my name on Google, it would say Jason Barnard is a blue dog, and that‚Äôs not professional. And I realised the result for my name on Google is my business card. When I was pitching to clients, they would google me even during a Zoom meeting or after a meeting. And so, I worked to get it to change from Jason Barnard is a blue dog to Jason Barnard is a credible, authoritative expert in Google. And it worked."
Jason Barnard (The Brand SERP Guy) on Accepting Changes, Deciding What to Do Next, and Preparing for Lean Periods	"That‚Äôs brilliantly put. And I think, as you say, a lot of people think, oh, I can‚Äôt do that because it‚Äôs too different, or I can‚Äôt do that because I‚Äôm in my safe place, my safe lane, and it‚Äôs working okay. And actually, each of those changes wasn‚Äôt a choice. It was forced on me. And it was just what I was doing was stopped very abruptly in each case, and I just had to decide what I would do next. And I think what was lovely is I could sit and think, what do I want to do next, rather than, what do I need to do next to make a living. 

[00:05:59] The Brand SERP Guy (Jason Barnard): And to be honest with you, I was talking to my daughter the other day and she was saying, I remember as a child, there were periods when we had lots of money and nobody ever worried about money, and there were periods when we had to worry about money and we didn‚Äôt have that much to spend. And that‚Äôs part of it, I think, as well. You have to be prepared to go through those lean periods. And if you‚Äôre not prepared to do that, then stick to your safe lanes, because the lean periods are always going to come and they‚Äôre always going to be there.

[00:06:29] The Brand SERP Guy (Jason Barnard): And somebody else asked me about running my own company and saying, I don‚Äôt have the motivation to get up every morning and do it, and I would be worried constantly about the income. And I get that. And I think it takes a specific kind of person not to worry about it. And if you‚Äôre going to worry about it all the time, you‚Äôll make yourself ill, you‚Äôll get an ulcer, and you won‚Äôt sleep. So, I think you have to be honest with yourself about what you are willing to put up with in terms of lean periods and worry about income."
Jason Barnard‚Äôs Experience of Living in a Tropical Island, Where It Is Always Warm and Quite Boring	Oh, right. I went there and stayed 13 years. And when you go to Mauritius, what‚Äôs lovely about a tropical island is it‚Äôs warm all year, but it‚Äôs also quite boring. And you get up in the morning and say, oh, not another really sunny day, which is terribly ironic. And the other thing is, in Mauritius at least, we didn‚Äôt really have seasons and we didn‚Äôt have different hours or different darkness hours. It was pretty much, gets light at 6AM, gets dark at 6PM, day in, day out, throughout the year. And the weather, hot to very hot was your choice.
Writing and Publishing a Book May Not Make Enough Money, But It Brings Authority to the Author	"You‚Äôre not cheating. It‚Äôs just when you look at it business wise, and I look at my clients, most of my clients are entrepreneurs, professional speakers, and coaches. At this time of the year, they‚Äôre just focusing on getting through everything, so they can take that Christmas break. 

[00:10:29] The Brand SERP Guy (Jason Barnard): That‚Äôs a really good point. I think I‚Äôve taken on too much, but that‚Äôs a story for another day. I was looking at the title from Author to Authority. I find that really intriguing because I published my first book in January of this year, and it sold 500 copies, which is reasonable. It didn‚Äôt make me any money, but it has made me a recognised authority, both in the eyes of my audience or my industry, but also by Google. It‚Äôs been hugely helpful in getting Google to understand my topical authority on Brand SERPs, search engine results page for a brand name.

[00:11:10] The Brand SERP Guy (Jason Barnard): And so, the book, in and of itself, is not a great business move in terms of it took me 6 months and made me 500 times a couple of dollars, so a thousand dollars, let‚Äôs say, from sales through Amazon and self-publishing, but it‚Äôs brought me a lot of authority and a lot of business thanks to that authority."
Besides Sales and Credibility, Google Will Also Easily Represent You to Your Audience if You Put Your Books on Google Books	"People ask me, what kind of ROI can I expect from publishing a book? And I said, don‚Äôt expect to make money from book sales because that‚Äôs not what you use the book for. Like you said, people see you differently as soon as you become an author. You become a more credible expert than someone who‚Äôs not an author, and it‚Äôs not true. It‚Äôs a perception.

[00:11:57] The Brand SERP Guy (Jason Barnard): Oh, a hundred percent. And a lot of life is about perception. It isn‚Äôt about getting more contacts necessarily, but closing more deals more easily. And from a Google perspective, if you look at the Brand SERP, what people see when they search your name, because Google understands books very well, it will understand the author. And that means that writing a book and publishing it and putting it on Google Books will mean that Google will naturally and easily be able to represent you to your audience when they google your name correctly around the topic of that book."
Kalicube, Jason Barnard‚Äôs Company, Helped a Client by Educating Google About Who He Is Today as a Business Book Author	"A hundred percent. And the thing about it is you don‚Äôt get rid of the books. They‚Äôre part of your history. They‚Äôre part of your story. And one thing that is important, and we‚Äôre doing it for a client right now, is that he has written, I think, 14 or 15 books. And the wrong ones are coming up on Google when people search his name. And he‚Äôs saying, that makes me look not as credible as I would like to because they‚Äôre children‚Äôs books, I want to become more credible within the business space, and I‚Äôve written 3 business books, but Google isn‚Äôt showing them. 

[00:13:53] The Brand SERP Guy (Jason Barnard): So, part of what we do at Kalicube is to educate Google about who he is today. And so, basically, we provide Google with the information that allows it to fully understand that the children‚Äôs books were a past career, like my blue dog was a past career, and his current career is very much around business books. And so, we promote those books to the top. The other books still exist, but they‚Äôre lower down.

[00:14:20] The Brand SERP Guy (Jason Barnard): And for the blue dog, for example, if you search my name, Jason Barnard, you‚Äôll see that the blue dog is still on the Brand SERP. You‚Äôll still see the blue dog, but he doesn‚Äôt take up very much space because he‚Äôs not relevant today. That‚Äôs crucial for Google, and it‚Äôs crucial for us as authors, business people, entrepreneurs, whatever it is we do in life, to make sure Google‚Äôs representing who we are today, because we all have a history and our histories are all mixed and matched and changing. And the current situation is what we want our audience to see or I would imagine."
What Are Some Things That Entrepreneurs, Speakers, and Coaches Can Do to Start Improving Their Brand SERPs?	"the first thing is to identify entities, and that sounds really complicated, but it isn‚Äôt. You‚Äôve got to disassociate yourself from your company. If you have a company, that‚Äôs one thing, and you yourself are another, and you own the company. Even if it‚Äôs only you in the company, it doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs two different things. 

[00:15:49] The Brand SERP Guy (Jason Barnard): And you need to educate Google about who the company is, what that company does, and which audience that company serves, who you are, what you do, and which audience you serve. And obviously, the audiences and the topicality are going to be very similar, but you need to identify that it‚Äôs two different entities. That‚Äôs number on"
After Identifying Entities, the Next Step Is to Make Sure You Have an Entity Home That Google Will Believe	"Number two is to make sure that those entities have a home, what we‚Äôre calling Entity Home. It‚Äôs somewhere the entity lives online, a page that is controlled by the entity, the person or the company. And Google is actively looking for that page online that explains who you are, what you do, and which audience you serve. 

[00:16:31] The Brand SERP Guy (Jason Barnard): And there you can explain to Google the facts, what your priorities are, which of the books you want to put at the top of the Google search results. You put them at the top of your page, this is current, and then you go down backwards through your life to the bottom, which is least current, i.e. in the past, right at the bottom.

[00:16:48] The Brand SERP Guy (Jason Barnard): And Google will look at that, and it will go around the web, and it will find all the corroborative sources that prove what you‚Äôre saying. And at that point, it will believe you. So, it doesn‚Äôt just believe you because you say it, but it wants your version of the story and then it will check. And if your story checks out, you‚Äôll get a great Brand SERP."
Some of the Platforms That You Can Easily Use and Services Offered for Optimising Your Brand SERP	"Well, in fact, if you go to kalicube.com, you‚Äôll see that we have a vast amount of free information. We don‚Äôt keep secrets. We share all of this with everybody, because our philosophy is every person and every company who has any kind of digital presence needs to look after their Brand SERP. And we can‚Äôt possibly serve them all, so we might as well share how we do it. And then those who want to do it, who want to spend the time learning and look after it themselves, you‚Äôre welcome. 

[00:17:57] The Brand SERP Guy (Jason Barnard): And for those who don‚Äôt and want us to do it, we‚Äôll do it for you. If you‚Äôve got a particularly difficult problem, you‚Äôll probably need our help. But basically, if you have that Entity Home and you explain very clearly who you are, what you do, and which audience you serve, and what your priorities are of what you want Google to show, if it checks out, as I said, it will show that. And you don‚Äôt need to be geeky. It can be a one page website."
Besides Kalicube‚Äôs Services and Offers, Platforms Like Duda and Wix Are Simple to Use and Don‚Äôt Need Any Technical Skills	"We currently use Duda. Duda is really simple to use. It‚Äôs a really great platform. I used to use WordPress. WordPress can get geeky and complicated very quickly. Duda is simply not complicated. Wix is another good one. So, Duda or Wix, create yourself a one page website. You can put that up in a couple of hours. It doesn‚Äôt need any technical skills.

[00:18:42] The Brand SERP Guy (Jason Barnard): And then if you think you need to be geeky, we‚Äôve got a guy called G. Scott Graham, who came for one hour of consultancy with me. I told him exactly what he needed to do. We recorded the consultancy session. I sent him the recording with a transcript. He executed everything that I told him to do. And he went from no Knowledge Panel to a brilliant Knowledge Panel with his books, with his social media profiles, with the description, with his photos. And it was really simple, and he didn‚Äôt write one line of code. It was great photos, great description, and linking out to all the sources that corroborate what he was saying on his Entity Home. Simple."
The Credibility You Could Get From Google if You Have a Knowledge Panel	"The Brand SERP is the whole result. But on desktop, if you look at Google results, you‚Äôll see there‚Äôs a left hand side and a right hand side. The left hand side is the blue links, video boxes, things like that. That‚Äôs Google‚Äôs suggestions and recommendations. On the right hand side, you‚Äôll see an information box. That‚Äôs the fact according to Google. So, the Knowledge Panel is part of the Brand SERP, and it‚Äôs Google‚Äôs understanding of the facts. 

[00:19:53] The Brand SERP Guy (Jason Barnard): So, having that makes you look incredibly credible, if I can say incredibly credible, because Google has understood you and is validating who you say you are. And it‚Äôs basically Google‚Äôs stamp of approval. This person is an authority. This person is important. This person is worth looking for. And if you don‚Äôt have one, when somebody googles your personal name, you should get one."
If You Want to Get Results, There Are Things You Should Do as an Advice From an Authority or Expert	I think because it affects Hugo‚Äôs sensibilities, I think, I better be careful about it in general, but in fact you‚Äôre right. As an expert, as you said, if you want your Google Business Card to look great, if you want Google‚Äôs stamp of approval, if you want to look credible and authoritative when somebody googles your name, you should work on your Entity Home, and you should write a clear description, and you should have the photos, and you should have that bio that shows what‚Äôs important right at the top.
Kalicube Offers Courses and Free Learning Resources Where It Explains the Hows and Whys of Brand SERPs	"And it really is simple. What I find astonishing is what I‚Äôm teaching and what I‚Äôm talking about is so simple. Anybody can do it. You go to kalicube.com, you look in the learning resources, everything is there. And it‚Äôs free. 

[00:22:15] Kim Thompson-Pinder: And it‚Äôs free. I love free.

[00:22:19] The Brand SERP Guy (Jason Barnard): For us, the idea of saying if you really want to geek out, we‚Äôve got courses and you can buy courses and you can learn from me. We‚Äôve got 12 hours of video lessons about all the details and all the technical stuff, and you can really get into the meat of the whole question and really understand it, but you don‚Äôt need to understand it in order to do it. And that was something I made a mistake with a few years ago. I wanted everybody to understand the why. And in fact, people only want to know what do I need to do? 

[00:22:50] The Brand SERP Guy (Jason Barnard): So, I‚Äôm focusing much more on the how, and kalicube.com explains the how. It also explains the why, but you don‚Äôt need to read the why, so you have the choice. Whereas if you‚Äôre going to take the courses, you‚Äôre going to get a lot of why this is the case, because it will help you to understand better why you‚Äôre doing things and how to expand it and apply it to different case scenarios."
The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of Jason Barnard‚Äôs Book Writing Process	"I‚Äôll talk about the first book. The good, the bad, and the ugly was I thought I was being very clear. And I got some help from a real writer called Emily Batdorf, who rewrote it. And it didn‚Äôt make any sense. And I read it and I thought, but I didn‚Äôt say that, and she had misunderstood. And it wasn‚Äôt that she wasn‚Äôt clever. She is very clever. It was that I hadn‚Äôt explained it clearly, and I hadn‚Äôt been able to put myself at everybody else‚Äôs level in terms of not intelligence, but understanding of the situation, understanding of Google.

You have to understand what level your audience is at.

JASON BARNARD (THE BRAND SERP GUY)
[00:24:08] The Brand SERP Guy (Jason Barnard): And that taught me an incredibly valuable lesson about not overestimating your audience and not underestimating your audience obviously either, but you have to understand what level your audience is at and right at that level. And it‚Äôs very difficult to do. For me, there are so many things that are obvious that I think that‚Äôs not even worth explaining. And Emily would say to me, you have to explain it, like what is a Knowledge Panel, for example. Because if people don‚Äôt understand what it is, they won‚Äôt understand a word of what you‚Äôre saying. So, that was an incredibly valuable lesson, and that‚Äôs why it took six months. I think I now do a better job."
Besides Considering Your Audience, an Author Should Not Also Be Scared of Repeating Information When Writing Their Book	"The second point that I‚Äôm starting to realise is that I shouldn‚Äôt be scared of repeating myself. And what I‚Äôve noticed by reading the newspaper, for example, is you read an article about the American elections and they will repeat little sentences. They would repeat something I‚Äôd read a week ago, and I think, well, I already know that. And I now realise that they need to do that for people who hadn‚Äôt read that article. And the fact that I had read the article, I just skipped through the sentences very quickly. 

[00:25:11] The Brand SERP Guy (Jason Barnard): So, as long as they‚Äôre not overly heavy with the explanation, you don‚Äôt go into detail. They just say, this happened last month, click here to learn more, or a link through to the full article. You don‚Äôt need to be scared about repeating yourself because you need to keep people on board. And the idea that I said something in chapter 1 and the person gets to chapter 12, and they still remember exactly what I said in one particular sentence in chapter 1 is a foolish mistake.

[00:25:36] The Brand SERP Guy (Jason Barnard): And that repeating, as said in chapter 1, the Knowledge Panel is the information box on the right, then it reminds them they can go back to chapter 1 to read that. And we don‚Äôt bore people who did remember it, but we keep people on board who didn‚Äôt necessarily remember it or skipped the chapter completely."
Keeping People On Board, Giving Yourself Time to Digest Information, and Seeing Other Perceptions of How You Can Say Things	"I was speaking about my particular topic, which is actually very geeky. So, you need to keep people on board and need to be sure that people, as you‚Äôre reading, you don‚Äôt remember and digest everything. That was something I learned when I was doing the blue dog and yellow koala, because we were learning how to make Flash animations, websites, run a huge server, and then we did a TV series.

[00:27:23] The Brand SERP Guy (Jason Barnard): And what I realised after a while is I would be really stressed out because I didn‚Äôt understand how to do something. And once I gave myself a little bit of leeway and said, well, I‚Äôll keep working and in 2 weeks or 3 weeks, it will all drop into place and don‚Äôt put pressure on myself. And I think that‚Äôs one of the things in learning that people forget. You are not going to understand everything today, even if you‚Äôve read it all. You need to digest, reread, see other information, see other perceptions of how that can be said, and it will drop into place."
An Idea of the Timeline of the Changes You Will Observe When Optimising Your Brand SERP	"I think that‚Äôs even true with your Brand SERP. You‚Äôre not going to understand everything at first, so you just start with the basics. Get the basics and don‚Äôt worry about trying to get everything Google wants. Just start working towards having Google. See what you want to see. Because it‚Äôs going to be a process anyway. Your Google is not going to change overnight. It‚Äôs going to change over a period of time, so just start working on it. 

[00:28:17] The Brand SERP Guy (Jason Barnard): And to give you an idea of the timeline, you‚Äôll start to see changes in a week. If you change your own webpage, which is ranking, that will change in a week. You will start to see a change in structure in about 3 months, if you work diligently. And you will begin to feel that you have control after a year. So, those are your timelines. 

[00:28:39] The Brand SERP Guy (Jason Barnard): A few weeks to see some nice changes where you‚Äôre starting to think, oh, that‚Äôs pretty cool. After 3 months, you‚Äôll start to see the design. Let‚Äôs say, the design of your Google Business Card is changing and becoming something closer to what you want, and it‚Äôs representing you more accurately. And after a year of good, solid work, you‚Äôll have a Brand SERP that represents you and that you, more or less, control."
Where Can People Go to Connect With Jason Barnard (The Brand SERP Guy)?	"This is a lovely question that I enjoy greatly. Because if you want to connect with me, search my name, Jason Barnard, and Google will present you not only with my Google Business Card, but with a choice of where you can connect with me and how you want to connect with me, which means that I don‚Äôt impose it on you. So, what you will see is my Knowledge Panel with the facts, my website, number one, Twitter, number two maybe, my company website, if you want to do business, number three, LinkedIn, if you want to connect on LinkedIn. That‚Äôs B2B. Twitter is more fun. 

[00:29:59] The Brand SERP Guy (Jason Barnard): My own website would be if you wanted to know more about me as a human being. You‚Äôve got my YouTube channel. You‚Äôve got my articles on Search Engine Journal, Search Engine Land. And as you can see, I‚Äôve described these different ways that you can engage with me through the videos, the articles, my personal life, my business, or just learn about me factually from the Knowledge Panel. It‚Äôs up to you, and I think that is the secret of a great Brand SERP."
Key Moments in episode 19 of the Daily Brand SERP series:	"The category in your Knowledge Panel is a great pointer to how well Google understands Who You Are, What You Do and Who Your Audience Is. Today, I‚Äôm taking a closer look at the Brand SERP for Burger King and Dominos ‚Äì not to compare how good their food is, but to compare how good each is at getting understood by search engines.

Kalicube‚Äôs #DailyBrandSERP  July 27th 2021 presented by the Brand SERP Guy, Jason Barnard.

Transcript:
Hi. Today, we‚Äôre looking at Burger King‚Äôs Brand SERP. It‚Äôs lovely. It‚Äôs got its restaurants in the Map Pack there. It‚Äôs got a lovely Knowledge Panel. It‚Äôs got some People Also Ask. It‚Äôs got some stories and some images of burgers. If you like burgers, that‚Äôs delightful. But today we‚Äôre going to be talking about this aspect of the Brand SERP.

Now here, they‚Äôre called a fast food restaurant company. That‚Äôs really specific as a subtitle in a Knowledge Panel.

And to show you just how we look at Domino‚Äôs and it‚Äôs just a restaurant company. Now that‚Äôs probably because Google understood Burger King better than they‚Äôve understood Domino‚Äôs in the Knowledge Graph. It isn‚Äôt a value judgment on the quality of their food. Thank you very much."
Presentation of Branded Search (and Beyond) with Jason Barnard ‚Äì Podcast	"Branded Search (and Beyond) with Jason Barnard‚Äù is a podcast series that started as an excuse for me to travel the world interviewing smart digital marketers. The series kicked off in Paris in January 2019, and the wonderful Anders Hjorth was the very first person I interviewed and the first person to hear the song ‚ÄúA Quick Hello and we‚Äôre good to go, welcome to the show, Anders Hjorth‚Äù. 

There are literally hundreds of episodes now, and every single guest is one of the smartest people in digital marketing in the world, so this is well worth your time digging into the series.

Since June 2020 we have published an audio version of every regular episode of Kalicube Tuesdays as part of the series. That‚Äôs a great way to keep up with the conversations on Kalicube Tuesdays if you can‚Äôt make the live stream show.

What Kalicube Offers You Around Brand SERPs and Knowledge Panels ‚Äì Introduction	"Hi, I‚Äôm Jason Barnard. I‚Äôm The Brand SERP Guy and in this video I‚Äôll briefly present to you what we at Kalicube have to offer you around Brand SERPs and Knowledge Panels. Here‚Äôs the list. I‚Äôll give you a second or two to read that.

While you‚Äôre reading the list, I‚Äôll explain that a Brand SERP is the search result your audience sees when they Google your name, or the name of your company. But Brand SERPs extend to any Entity ‚Äì books, films, podcasts, products‚Ä¶ so Brand SERPs are incredibly important for absolutely every person, business, podcast, book and product.

Before I go through what Kalicube offers around Brand SERPs and Knowledge Panels, I thought I‚Äôd share with you how I became obsessed with Brand SERPs. It all started with a cartoon blue dog !

Back in 2012 I was pitching for work as an SEO consultant, but after meetings with incredibly enthusiastic clients who seemed ready to sign on the dotted line, all too often the clients didn‚Äôt sign. Turns out, after the meetings they were googling my name. And my Brand SERP  focused on Boowa, the cartoon blue dog from my previous career. The companies didn‚Äôt want to entrust their digital marketing strategy to a cartoon blue dog! So I set about changing my Brand SERP to ensure that Google projected a professional image of me as a digital marker first and foremost. It took me three months, and it worked wonderfully!‚Ä¶ I converted more prospects, made a better living and then built a whole career as The Brand SERP Guy üôÇ

I now own and run Kalicube ‚Äì a marketing agency that is pioneering the art and science of Brand SERP optimisation and managing Knowledge Panel management. As you can see, we offer books, an Academy, and a SaaS platform for agencies‚Ä¶ not to mention masses of free resources, as you‚Äôll see üôÇ"
Presentation of The Fundamentals of Brand SERPs for Business by Jason Barnard	"If you‚Äôre a Brand SERP beginner, and you want to join me in this wonderful, delightful world, then this book is absolutely for you. The Fundamentals of Brand SERPs for Business is the first time my approach to Brand SERPs has been brought together in one place in an easy to understand format. It‚Äôs a concentration of the key take-aways I have learned from over 10 years working on Brand SERPs for myself and my clients. 

I got some help from a professional writer to make the book a real page-turner and ensure it is accessible for any business owner or marketer. I‚Äôm incredibly happy with the book because we made it accessible to everyone whilst also bringing value to seasoned SEO experts. People in the digital marketing industry who say they learned a lot reading the book include Joost de Valk, David Amerland, Marie Haynes and Eli Schwartz. Marie Haynes even said she wished she‚Äôd read this 5 years ago which is an incredible compliment to pay üôÇ

The book sets out not only why you should care about your Brand SERP, but also what you should be doing to start extracting the maximum benefit from it. Obviously your ‚ÄúGoogle Business Card‚Äù needs to be positive, accurate and convincing for your audience when they Google your name‚Ä¶ but the book also shows how anyone can gain great insights into their digital ecosystem, and start building an incredibly effective, efficient and super solid long-term digital strategy by ‚Äúbuilding from the Brand SERP outwards‚Äù.

Whether you‚Äôre a brand manager, a public relations specialist, a marketer or an SEO, if you‚Äôre starting to get interested in Brand SERPs and you want to get to work improving yours, or you want to help someone else with theirs, then the book is a really great place to start.

Presentationof Kalicube Academy and Brand SERP Courses by Jason Barnard	"The Brand SERP and Knowledge Panel courses in the Kalicube Academy are intermediate level for Brand SERP aficionados. Whether or not you have SEO experience,‚Ä¶. if you have even just a little experience with Brand SERPs, then the Academy will take you to the next level. The courses are totally unique. Nobody else offers anything even close. If you are interested in actively and proactively managing and optimising Brand SERP and managing your Knowledge Panel, and you are truly sold on the idea of delving deeper into the world of Brand SERPs, then joining the Kalicube Academy will be a no-brainer for you! 

I got some help from less experienced SEOs to ensure the courses make sense to every level from marketers just starting out on the Internet to SEOs with years of experience. I‚Äôm incredibly proud of the courses because we manage to strike a neat balance of being accessible to a wide audience of generalist digital marketers whilst also bringing value to experienced SEOs ‚Äì Brand SERPs is such a niche in the SEO industry so many techniques and strategies are new and innovative, even for experienced SEOs like Dave Davis and Mordy Oberstein.  

And John Mueller from Google has been incredibly positive and supportive of my work on Brand SERPs and Knowledge Panels as you can see from these Tweets. He also says that brands should put much more focus on ‚ÄúPull‚Äù search queries. Pull queries is Google-speak for search queries that contain a brand name. Obviously, Brand SERPs are right at the heart of the pull-search approach that John Mueller and Google actively recommend.

One last point here is that the courses are a great learning resource for Public Relations and Online Reputation Management experts. The courses bring a new approach to both professions. At their core, both professions are fundamentally about Brand SERPs, and the accessible SEO techniques I use to improve Brand SERPs will solve most PR and ORM problems.

In the Kalicube Academy courses, you‚Äôll find everything you‚Äôll need for your personal or company Brand SERP, from optimising your homepage to Rich Sitelinks, video strategies, content creation, copywriting, social media, PR outreach, Google Ads, removing negative results, making the most of customer reviews, getting and managing a Knowledge Panel‚Ä¶  and much, much more! 

In short, the Kalicube Academy provides you with the tips, tricks and strategies you‚Äôll need to optimise your Brand SERP and manage your Knowledge Panel ‚Ä¶ and leverage that work to drive an efficient, effective, and ultimately successful digital strategy by ‚Äúbuilding from the Brand SERP outwards‚Äù.

Presentation of The Daily Brand SERP With The Brand SERP Guy, Jason Barnard	"The Daily Brand SERP is a video series where I analyse one aspect of one individual Brand SERP: a company, a product, a person ‚Äì famous or not ‚Äì a podcast, a music album, a movie or a local business. In fact, any Entity üôÇ In less than 2 minutes, I analyse one thing that‚Äôs interesting or important or new or helpful‚Ä¶ or something that‚Äôs unusual, unexpected or fun. 

The idea is to get more people thinking about Brand SERPs and hopefully seeing how incredibly interesting Brand SERPs and Knowledge Panels are‚Ä¶ perhaps even understanding how much marketers like us can learn from Brand SERPs, and how much we can do to manage and control them.

Maximizing Your Visibility on Google: A Guide to the Knowledge Vault and Knowledge Graph	This entire course is designed to help you get the facts about your business into Google‚Äôs mind. We will learn more about how the Knowledge Vault is a huge Knowledge Graph that contains 150 billion facts, how Entity Home is the web page where Google's algorithms search for information about the Entity from the Entity, and how Google's Knowledge Graph tries to match the best offer from the best provider to the person asking the question or presenting the problem. In this course, you'll learn how to educate Google so it understands who you are and what you have to offer, learn how to get a Knowledge Panel, a Knowledge Graph that Google uses when your target audience Googles your name, and learn how to seize the right opportunity to be included in Google's Knowledge Vault. Jason also explains which opportunities make sense, what tactics, techniques, and strategies work to get a Knowledge Panel in the short term, how to get included in Google's Knowledge Vault, and how to build trust.
Google's Knowledge Algorithms: Understanding Information Reconciliation on the Web	In this lesson, we will find out how Google's child algorithm tries to reconcile fragmented information it finds on the web into a meaningful and reliable version. The simple trick is to compare the data it deduces from the World Wide Web with the information from other corroborative sources. Google needs to build that understanding by finding the entity home for each entity. The key to educating Google is that you identify corroborating sources that have current authority, expertise, and trustworthiness. This is the point of reconciliation between Google and the child. The child always needs a source to turn to when information changes or when in doubt - and that source is always the parent. For corroboration, we look for sources that are expert, authoritative, and trustworthy in your specialisation, geo region, and entity type. That's exactly what the Kalicube Pro SaaS platform is designed for. Schema markup, simple hyperlinks, and semantic triples are all ways to connect the dots. Which is explained in more detail in the video for this lesson‚Ä¶
Getting a Knowledge Panel: Educating Google about Your Business	Let's see how we can get a Knowledge Panel by providing Google with your version of the facts and ensuring that it is corroborated by multiple trusted authoritative sources through watching this lesson. Google, on the other hand, is slow to understand and even slower to be confident in its understanding. Google is seeking your version of the facts about you. A big part of this course is figuring out how to make it recognize you as an authority on yourself. Google recognizes your website, but you must persuade it to believe the information you provide. This is by no means rocket science. It is something that any marketer or brand manager can do. Obtaining and managing a Knowledge Panel is entirely dependent on your ability to communicate clearly and unambiguously. Google pulls information from the entire internet to populate your Knowledge Panel. Your industry and geo-region have a big impact on the sources Google uses for the information displayed in Knowledge Panels.
Mastering Your Entity Identity: The Importance of the Knowledge Panel in Google's SERP	In this lesson, we'll look at how important it is to use the Knowledge Panel to determine how well Google has understood you. Google's understanding of your Entity Identity serves as the foundation for all of Google's SERP representation of you. When you do not own the Knowledge Panel, Google will default to the homepage of the company that represents the company. Google's default is something you must follow, at least for the time being in 2022. You must own Google's Knowledge Panel, which is the foundational stone of Google's understanding of who you are, what you do, and who your audience is. Google will use this to drive everything in SEO, your Knowledge Panel, Google SERPs in general, and something else. Accept and stabilise it if it has chosen the homepage. And, in a few years, we'll figure out how to change the Entity Home from the homepage to a dedicated AboutPage, which will make life so much easier.
Crafting Your Entity Description: Balancing Clarity and Attractiveness for Google	The Entity description is the second most important thing next to Entity Home. This is a Google-friendly description of your entity. You need to strike a balance between being obvious to Google and being attractive to your audience. "Jason Barnard is an author, a digital marketer, a musician, and a blue cartoon blue dog," is a good starting point for an Entity description. Capitalising a word or group of words indicates to Google that they are proper nouns, allowing Google to understand the entities and relationships. Writing a description in multiple modules helps Google understand when things are clearly segmented. It also creates a modular system that allows you to rearrange or remove parts that are not relevant to your audience. The placement of modules on your Entity Home is critical. The modularity of the description solves the problem of different audiences on different platforms, as well as platform-specific limitations. Google makes an exception in this case. You should focus on writing a clear, consistent, factual, and modular description that Google will eventually understand. How?... learn more in the video for this lesson.
Building Google's Trust through Confirmation of Credible Authoritative Sites: A Lesson on Entity Corroboration	In this lesson, we will find out why we need confirmation from credible first, second and third authoritative sites. Corroboration on first-party websites have a rapidly diminishing return on investment. Human-curated, collaborative sites like Wikipedia are technically second party, but because they are curated by humans, they can be considered third party. There are simple and general rules you can follow to ensure you choose the correct corroboration for your named entities, which you will learn in this lesson. Each entity requires different amounts of each factor, and each factor interacts with the others as well as with Google's initial perception of the entity. The first step to creating the easiest record puzzle for Google is to do some spring cleaning. Correct all information on all third party websites. You do not need to worry about repetition on your Brand SERP; Google will take care of it automatically. Parts of this description will naturally appear on multiple platforms - think of it like a fragmented plate. The important thing is that you learn at least some of the information from this lesson, so you need to be adaptable. Repeating what you say on the Entity Home on first, second and third sources will increase Google's trust. Jason Barnard of Kalicube says building Google's trust will be part of an ongoing digital PR strategy that targets positive, accurate corroboration on relevant third-party sites.
Balancing User Experience with Google's Needs when Connecting the Dots on Your Entity Home	In this lesson, we will learn that joining the dots requires confidence, trust, and reliability. To give Google the impression that you are reliable, you need to connect the dots. The concept of reliability is about showing first, second, and third party sources that accurately confirm the information you provide on the Entity Home. To best serve Google without compromising the user experience, you need to be smart on the Entity Home. If you use fewer hyperlinks, you slow down the process of obtaining a Knowledge Panel, but you do not stop it. You need to strike a balance between the needs of Google and your users. You will also learn in this lesson the need to use your judgement to balance the user experience with Google's needs. Creating an HTML table with the links is an option that can be useful in some cases. Google interprets the visible links on the entity's home page as sources recommended by the entity. To be perceived as trustworthy, it is important to tell the truth and do so consistently over time. Using links, create a self-confirming loop of corroboration with the entity home as the epicenter. Google will go through the entire loop periodically, so you will need to update the information on all pages at the same time.
Enhancing Entity Information with Schema Markup: The Power of Connecting the Dots for Google	In this lesson, you will learn more about using Schema markup as Google's geeky way of connecting the dots and bringing everything together. Considering Schema.org as Google's native language, it allows you to include additional information and corroboration that you would not have been able to include otherwise. Google also has trouble distinguishing between multiple entities on the same page, so you should really only use pages that really only refer to that specific entity. You should start with a person's first name, last name, date of birth, place of birth, gender, nationality, job title, employer, and photo. For an event series, film, podcast or other artistic work, you should include properties such as name, alternate names, production date, director, screenwriters, actors, producers and so on. We generate the schema in the Kalicube Pro SaaS platform and limit ourselves to the properties we know are most important for each entity type. Start with the most well-known relationships and work your way to the strongest, longest, and closest relationships. You will understand this better after watching the video for this lesson.
Unlocking the Power of Google's Knowledge Graph: Understanding Nodes, Attributes, Edges, and Paths	In this lesson, we will learn more about how Google's Knowledge Graph works. It is composed of nodes, attributes, edges, and paths. Understanding this is extremely useful when you are trying to add information to a Knowledge Graph from the outside, as we are doing here with Google's Kalicube tool. According to the data, information that is not corroborated by one of the main sources mentioned in this lesson is not initially added to the Knowledge Graph. Since around 2020, Google has given the algorithms the freedom to determine facts and add information from the Google Web Index to the Knowledge Graph. As of September 2022, human-curated trunk accounts for 71%, human-curated solid branches of Google account for 15%, machine-defined facts account for 12%, and open web branches account for 2%. By specifying a relationship to existing entities, you can add entities to Google's Knowledge Graph. It is best to use the entities with which you have the closest, strongest, and longest relationship. However, do not try to connect your entity to a "core" entity unless there is a real, meaningful relationship Google maps the path from one entity to another using the Knowledge Graph and displays it in the SERPs in the form of carousels and other rich elements. This is a fantastic opportunity to get more visibility on Google properties like Google Search, Discover, Images, Books, Podcasts, YouTube and other services that Google will release.
Unlocking the Power of Google's Multiple Vertical Knowledge Graphs: A Guide to Triggering Knowledge Panels	In this lesson, we will look at how multiple Knowledge Graphs in the Google ecosystem trigger Knowledge Panels. Podcasts, Google Scholar, Google Books, YouTube Music, and even a Web Index Knowledge Graph are examples of Knowledge Graphs. No one, inside or outside Google, has direct access to the Knowledge Vault. If you want to be visible in Google's Knowledge Panel, the Knowledge Vault is not the place to start. The best short- and medium-term strategy depends heavily on the nature of the company and its presence - or lack thereof - in one or more of the company's verticals. Google's advantage of having several human-curated data sets, such as Google Books and Google Podcasts, is both an advantage and a disadvantage. Microsoft, on the other hand, has fewer knowledge bases of its own and has built its knowledge graph and Knowledge Panels directly from its Web index. Microsoft primarily uses its Web index to build a Knowledge Graph. This vertical Web index is the catalyst for a growing number of Knowledge Panels. By focusing on the relevant vertical, you can easily create a Knowledge Panel for podcasts, books, authors, scholars, and musicians. Each entity is assigned a unique identifier by Google. Each vertical assigns a kgmid to the entities within its domain. For users of a vertical like Google Books, this is not a problem. However, these Knowledge Graph verticals cannot directly compare their named entity to the same named entity in other verticals. If you have a Google Podcasts podcast, it will automatically generate a kgmid and most likely trigger a Knowledge Panel. If you have published a song or music album and it is available on YouTube Music, Spotify, or MusicBrainz, all of your songs, music albums, and yourself will have a kgmid. Businesses that are not obvious Google-owned industries can gain access to the Knowledge Vault. In a brand search, your business will create a Knowledge Panel and join the Knowledge Graph. All you need to do is be consistent and confident. Learn more in the video that accompanies this
How to Claim a Knowledge Panel on Google	You will learn in this lesson that you can only claim the Knowledge Panel if you are an entity (person) or represent the entity. If it was caused by Google Books, Google Podcasts, or any other Google property that no longer exists. You can claim it when you see the "Claim this Knowledge Panel" button. There are several ways to get a claimable Knowledge Panel. Google has a lengthy form that requires you to upload a photo of your passport. Another method is to use Search Console. Once Google's algorithms have determined which website represents the entity, you can claim the Knowledge Panel automatically. If a Knowledge Panel is triggered exclusively by untrusted or paid sources like WikiEverybody, Wikitia and others, the human reviewing your query will most likely just delete it. The three-step process developed by Kalicube is the best, safest and most reliable way to get Google to recognize the Entity Home and social profiles and include additional information in the Knowledge Panel. Google has chosen the Entity Home when you see a world icon next to your domain name. This means that you can definitely make a claim through Google Search Console, which you will learn more about after watching the lesson video.
How to Change Information in a Knowledge Panel	In this lesson, you will learn how to change information in your Knowledge Panel. In a Knowledge Panel, you can request changes from Google employees. Anyone can suggest changes using the Feedback button in Knowledge Panels. If you have claimed the panel for yourself, your suggestions will be prioritised and have a greater chance of being accepted. You can also provide general feedback, such as if you are unhappy with the entity's current title or subtitle. Google uses machine learning to populate Knowledge Panels and grow the Knowledge Graph. The algorithms ultimately call the shots. When they think the human has made a mistake, they revert to their "truth". You have to investigate - play Sherlock Holmes - and figure out what the machine is misinterpreting. The feedback button represents only a tiny fraction of the data Google feeds into the machine. Every time a Google employee changes something in the Knowledge Panel, the machine gets another example of where it went wrong. However, this is only a small signal to the algorithms, and as we have seen, they can choose to ignore this particular correction. If there is none, make sure it accurately reflects your description. You can also add attributes to structured data from reputable sources like Wikipedia, Wikipedia or IMDB. In the Knowledge Panel, you can enter any information about an entity that Google wants its users to see. Looking at what is shown for entities of the same type, geographic region, and industry is the best way to determine what attributes you are likely to get from an entity. Learn more by watching the video that accompanies this lesson.
What Information Does Google Show in Knowledge Panels?	Google's Knowledge Panel provides a summary of important and useful factual information about a particular entity. What data does Google display in a Knowledge Panel? Of course, this depends on the type of entity, which will be discussed in this lesson. The purpose of the Knowledge Panel is to give the user a factual summary of the entity. When a Knowledge Panel is triggered by Google Podcasts, it only displays the title image and description. No other information can be added. The only exception is if you can transfer the podcast to the Knowledge Vault - and its Knowledge Panel is filled with useful information. Google Business profiles are an exception. You have access to certain items through your business profile account. You have only indirect control over information that cannot be edited in the GBP management interface. The Google Business Profile, in addition to your Knowledge Panel, will be available to every business starting in late 2022. On the other hand, the Knowledge Vault is where most of the information in a Knowledge Panel originates. In the Knowledge Vault, you relinquish control to faceless Wikipedia editors and administrators. The Knowledge Graph relies on the web index rather than information stored in a database. Learn more by watching the video that accompanies this lesson.
Understanding The Three Google Knowledge Algorithms	In this lesson, you will learn that machine learning algorithms drive every aspect of the Knowledge Vault, Knowledge Panels, and Brand SERPs. Jason Barnard explains how they work and what you can do to help them better understand your business. Google engineers are constantly adjusting the algorithms and feeding them new data. The Googlebot knowledge extraction algorithm generates structured data from unstructured online content. The Knowledge Panel algorithm determines what can be displayed in an entity's Knowledge Panel. The purpose of a Knowledge Panel in a SERP is to provide the user with a summary of factual information about an entity. Google's ultimate goal is to populate this Knowledge Panel with all the facts about everything. Since Google has several human-curated vertical knowledge graphs, one technique is to move entities from the vertical graphs to the Knowledge Vault. The algorithm has previously reviewed and confirmed each entity and piece of information in the Main Knowledge Graph. The Knowledge Vault algorithm evaluates several web resources that confirm the information in the vertical knowledge graph to the point that it is confident that the information is correct. The knowledge extraction algorithm is linked to the web crawling and web index and flags all the data as GoogleBot crawls the web. The Knowledge Vault algorithm requires that multiple corroborating sources be available at the same time. When changing information in the Knowledge Panel "dresser", it merges multiple annotated sources. The Knowledge Panel algorithm checks that facts are correct and up-to-date. The Knowledge Vault algorithm is updated in an unpredictable and sporadic manner. You can think of it like a monthly update. The key to all three algorithms is to present the information in a structured format and ensure that all first, second, and third web pages dedicated to the entity provide consistent corroboration.
Optimising for the GoogleBot Knowledge Extraction Algorithm: Techniques for Improved Discoverability and Prioritization	GoogleBot contains the Knowledge Extraction Algorithm. Before adding content to the index, it breaks it down into its component parts and annotates it. It tries to identify headings, menus, images, videos, schema markup, and other elements to indicate the nature of the information. The Knowledge Extraction Algorithm suffers greatly from cluttered, unstructured pages with inconsistent headings. Annotations with low confidence values are penalised by the other algorithms in terms of discoverability and prioritisation. Google analyses any written content using NLP, image analysis, video analysis, and other techniques in addition to HTML tagging and schema. Schema.org markup, HTML tables, headings, sections, and so on are critical to feeding the Knowledge Graph with facts about and around your entity. Googlebot benefits greatly from alt tags, captions, titles and such for images. Use semantic HTML5 - supplemental materials include links to two articles on best practices. Use informative anchor text for links to provide Googlebot with useful information about an entity. Use schema markup to understand the content of a page in what Google calls its "native language" Adding human-corrected subtitles to videos or chapter markup with titles are two other ways to provide clues and assistance to Googlebot. Jason suggests optimising the Entity Home as it serves as the hub for Google's knowledge algorithms. Each of these techniques is worth using on any other pages about the entity you control. Take every opportunity to support Google's Knowledge Extraction Algorithm. Watch the video for this lesson to learn m
How Knowledge Panels are Built on Google SERPs	Vertical Knowledge Graphs, as we learned in previous lessons, enable Knowledge Panels. However, in this lesson we will deepen your understanding of them. These IDs are stored in a centralised lookup table that all algorithms can access. Each Knowledge Graph vertical adds new entities to this table as they are created, and this information is used in their algorithms. The Knowledge Panel algorithm could simply create a Knowledge Panel for an entity based on the information stored in each of its drawers. This is extremely simple, but extremely powerful when managing Knowledge Panels. It gets complicated quickly, but once you understand the concept, it's very simple. Some of it can be modified using web index data, while other can only be accessed by humans. Some Knowledge Graph verticals have additional locked drawers with limited or no additional drawer options. An example of this is podcasts since 2022. Unless they are included in the Knowledge Vault, the information displayed in the Knowledge Panel is "locked" Since Google's Knowledge Graph API does not provide visibility into the information contained in the Knowledge Vault, it is unclear what information it controls. The Knowledge Vault contains all the information stored in the "root" of the Knowledge Vertical This means that if someone changes their name in the knowledge base from Author to Musician, the Web Index can overwrite and correct the information in that drawer. The Web Index algorithm has the final say on any drawers that lack such information. This explains why books can sometimes be removed from the Knowledge Vault or lost. The Knowledge Vault is also constantly updated, so information about an entity can change from day to day. The Knowledge Panel is designed to save searchers time and effort by eliminating the need to visit multiple pages in the left bar or blue link algorithm. Since some information is geo-sensitive, Google customises the Knowledge Panel by country. Knowledge Panels are real-time summaries of facts as understood by the dynamic knowledge algorithms that use the data flow of the web index. You gradually gain confidence in the information provided by such a page and thus by a particular website.
How to Get an Entity Into Google's Knowledge Vault	In this lesson, you will learn about Google's Knowledge Graph verticals, which include Google Books, Google Maps, and the Web Index. The current problem is that these verticals have difficulty communicating with each other horizontally. By adding both kgmid to the markup on the Entity Home, you can greatly help Google with deduplication. Google and Bing are trying to centralise knowledge and the application of that knowledge across all of their algorithms and services. Google manages to build pseudo-knowledge on the SERP in the form of its various curated vertical Knowledge Graphs, but everything else outside of the Knowledge Vault is peripheral, indirect, and temporary. Since the Knowledge Vault is entirely based on machine learning, the transition from human logic to machine logic is not easy. Individual entities from different domains are moved into the Knowledge Vault as Google's global knowledge algorithm gains confidence in its understanding of a named entity. Each vertical in the Knowledge Graph communicates only through its own lookup table. This means that there are numerous opportunities for duplicates of a named entity. This is a big problem for Google, because it needs to keep track of these duplicates and make sure they do not get lost. Google uses entities in two ways in its search algorithms. The Knowledge Vault, multiple vertical Knowledge Graph entries, and the kgmid lookup table are the most visible. We will look at how Google understands the pages it crawls, with your own pages being the most important. You need to be patient while the Knowledge Vault is in the data flow. The basic understanding Google uses to trigger a Knowledge Panel, especially from the Knowledge Vault, is still part of the Data River approach. Keep this in mind as you work to enable a Knowledge Panel.
How to Get Your Knowledge Panel to Show on Your Brand SERP	In this lesson, you will learn that many entities have Knowledge Panels, but they do not appear on Brand SERPs. So how can you get your Knowledge Panel to appear on Brand SERPs? Use Kalicube's three-step process and a good PR from relevant third-party articles about the company. In the United States, Mary Moore is an actress; in the United Kingdom, she is the daughter of Henry Moore. For Google, probability is a critical factor in selecting an item on a SERP. If you are competing against a well-known company, focus on your geographic region first and then spread out. If you are targeting a Knowledge Panel on a national level, you need to start small by replicating this process in other cities and relevant national news outlets. One solution for an individual is to give yourself a new name. Include a middle initial or your full middle name. You could also insert a related word, such as "Mark Preston SEO" Or adopt the moniker "Jase 'the bass' Barnard" Rebranding allows you to communicate and gain mentions, links and articles. Every major reference to the entity on first-, second- and third-party websites would need to be changed. But you would also need to communicate extensively with your target audience so they search for the new name. If you get a See Results About without a Knowledge Panel on the Brand SERP for your Entity, Google is not sure it understands it. It's also possible that it lacks sufficient information. So just click on the See Results. Even the most solid and dominant Knowledge Panels vary depending on where you are. If you are competing with an entity that is irrelevant to your geo-region, you should focus on PR, which includes mentions and links to your Entity Home from authoritative third-party sites. Once you have the Entity Home set up, a good description written, and everything tagged with or without schema, a targeted and highly relevant digital PR campaign is essential. Remember, you must first achieve this dominance and then maintain it over time. Learn more through watching the video that accompanies this lesson.
Managing People Also Search For and Related Searches	In this lesson, you will learn about people also search for and related searches. These are almost impossible to control or significantly influence. Google recently changed the search box dropdown result from Related Searches to People Also Search For. Different algorithms control the boxes in People Also Search For and Entity. Related Searches is more about web indexing, search volume and name similarity. Google seems to focus on the proximity, strength and duration of the relationship in related searches. Google's related searches aim to provide both disambiguation and research opportunities. Their influence is always indirect, and you cannot target anything in particular. The technique is to inform Google of strong, close, and long-lasting relationships with known entities. People Also Search For in the Knowledge Panel is very ontological and should be called "ontologically related searches" or "close entity equivalents" in Kalicube language. The PASF shows the geographic aspect of entity equivalents; Google sees the equivalent differently for a searcher in the United States than for a searcher in Australia. Entity Boxes are set up the same way as People Also Search For and are part of the Related Searches at the bottom of the Brand SERP. The algorithm is very similar, if not identical, with the exception that it searches for a related topic and displays Entity Equivalents from that topic. You need to understand your entity and its relationships to other entities, including topic entities. To trigger and manage these, you need to take Google training beyond Knowledge Panels to "the next level" At Kalicube, we will soon be developing a system to analyse these patterns and figure out how you can do this.
How Google Chooses What Photos and Logos to Show in a Knowledge Panel	In this lesson, you will learn how to add, modify, and add more photos and logos to a Knowledge Panel. If you have claimed the Knowledge Panel, you may be able to request that your preferred photo or logo be included. Google will often, but not always, use an image from Wikipedia. Google usually displays only one image for businesses, which is the dominant logo. To understand how the search engine chooses the images to display in your knowledge area when you search online, you need to understand the concept of a dominant group and the dominant photo in each group. Create groups, each with a dominant image, and then distribute them throughout the Web on first-, second-, and third-party sites. The key is to identify groups and make one group a dominant group, and then ensure that one photo from that group is clearly dominant in each group. You need to place the photos on multiple first-, second-, and third-party sites, just as you did with the image boxes for your Brand SERP. Google then determines dominance based on the frequency with which both groups and individual photos appear in those groups. The photo at the top of the page is considered and prioritised as the "suggested dominant photo." Google displays the cover and some inside pages of a book in Google Books Vertical. For podcasts, the cover of the show is displayed as defined in your podcast feed. The rules for other entity types can be very different, and you have no control over them.
Achieving a High Google Knowledge Graph Trust Score for Long-Term Visibility on SERP	If you have worked diligently through the lessons and applied the techniques and strategies recommended by Jason Barnard, you should have a Knowledge Panel after a few months. And if another vertical has previously triggered your Knowledge Panel, Google should have moved you to the Knowledge Vault, where you should be in the long run. Google's confidence in correctly identifying which web page is the entity's home page is critical to your efforts. The more you tell truthful things, the more it will believe you. Just remember that it takes time to gain a child's trust. You need absolute consistency in the sources you have (i.e., every first and second party source), as well as independent corroboration from as many authorised, trusted, and relevant brands as possible - the fact that you do not control them is a key factor in gaining Google's trust. Do not overdo it. Not every mention is valuable. Ignore it if less than 20% of the content on a third-party site is about the company. More than 80% is definitely worth including, but it's also likely a sameAs or subjectOf for your entity home. A loss of trust in Google can be unexpected, dizzying, and difficult to overcome. The "security level" you are aiming for is a Knowledge Graph trust score of 500 or higher. This almost guarantees that a massive shock, like deleting a Wikipedia page, will not "kill" the entity. It took Jason Barnard 10 years to get here. And this course contains almost everything he has learned from his successes and failures over the years. Just keep in mind that this process is usually slower than traditional SEO.
Explanation of How to Build Google's Confidence in Your Entity	"You now know how to best manage and influence the information Google shows your audience, and you understand how to correct information and get the visuals you want. So hopefully Google the child is now showing what you want, more or less.
All of that management aside, once Google has understood who you are, what you do and which audience you serve - which is the foundation of both your Brand SERP and your Knowledge Panel - your task is to build confidence in the mind of that child.
If you‚Äôve worked diligently through the lessons and applied the techniques and strategies I recommend, then after a few months you probably have a Knowledge Panel, and hopefully it is triggering on your Brand SERP when your audience Googles your brand name. And if another vertical was previously triggering your Knowledge Panel, hopefully Google has also moved you into the Knowledge Vault - which is where you need to be long term.
Once in the Knowledge Vault, you are in for the long haul. The long haul is building confidence.
The single most important thing Google needs to be confident about - be it the Knowledge Vault or the web index generated Knowledge Panel elements - is the Entity Home. Google‚Äôs confidence that it has correctly understood which web page is the Entity Home is crucial to your efforts since this is your hub, and the focal point of your capacity to educate the child. 
So you have the understanding in Google's mind, you have the Entity Home and you would imagine that that's the job done, but there is a huge difference between understanding and confidence in understanding. A good rule of thumb is once you are in the Knowledge Vault, when Google gives you a confidence score of 500 or more, then that confidence is sufficiently solid. You can check your status on the Kalicube Pro Knowledge Graph Explorer. 
But you also need to build trust. You can do that simply by being truthful over time. Much like with a child. The more you tell it things that turn out to be true, the more it will believe the next thing you explain. Obviously this takes time. Adding a piece of information to the Knowledge Vault or to a Knowledge Panel can take weeks or months. Building trust in the child‚Äôs mind takes years since it is the culmination of the truths you have told it. If you build sufficient trust then your ability to feed the child information through the Entity Home is vastly increased. Just bear in mind that building trust in a child‚Äôs mind takes years. 
Confidence will stabilize your place in the Knowledge Vault and also vastly improve the probability that your Knowledge Panel will trigger on your Brand SERP. It will also vastly reduce the risk of your Knowledge Panel being removed on any of Google's updates.
To build confidence you simply need absolute consistency on sources you own (that is every first and second party source), plus independent corroboration from as many third party authoritative trusted relevant brands as possible - the fact that you do not control them is the key booster in building Google's confidence

When you look at it from that perspective, once you have the Knowledge Panel - once you have explained the facts to the child - PR becomes foundational. You will build confidence in the child‚Äôs mind through pure repetition on relevant authoritative sources. 
In short, you need a well-focussed digital PR strategy. Third party sources who will corroborate what it is you are saying to a relevant audience.
I would recommend creating a section on your website that contains brief summaries and links out to every major mention of your Entity. I do this on my personal site and Kalicube does it too. Simply put, you create a dedicated page that contains a short summary of the corroborating mention with a link to it. That means Google sees confirmation from the Entity itself that the reference on that third party site is, indeed, about that specific named entity. 
Two things - create a dedicated section on your site in order to isolate it from your core customer content. Secondly, don't overdo it. Not every mention is worth it. If less than 20% of the content on the third party site is about the entity, ignore it. 20% to 80% - add a dedicated summary page to your site. Over 80% and that is definitely worth including, but is also probably a sameAs or subjectOf for your Entity Home.

Importantly, Google‚Äôs confidence in its understanding about your Entity will have a HUGE effect on how Google applies the signals Expertise, Authority, and Trustworthiness.
Signals for Expertise, Authority and Trustworthiness can only mean anything if Google has understood who you are.
As I explained in previous lessons, Google analyses individual pieces of content using Natural Language Processing algorithms and can generally make a good guess about the entities. You can also provide structured data to help it be more confident in its understanding. 
But the absolute pinnacle is the Knowledge Vault. When Google is using NLP to make a best guess, whatever E-A-T signals it is applying to that content are necessarily vastly dampened. 
Once the Entity is in the Knowledge Vault and Google is confident in the understanding about what the Entity is, what it offers and which audience it serves, then all and every single related to Expertise Authority and Trustworthiness can be FULLY applied. 
No doubts. Google is confident about his named Entity. Every E-A-T signal will be vastly amplified. 
A quick word of warning, though. A loss of confidence in Google‚Äôs mind can be sudden, vertiginous and difficult to repair.
An example of a hard hit your Entity might take in terms of confidence are page deletion in Wikipedia and Wikidata. Since these are sources the child has been taught to trust, if an article appears and sticks for a month or more, the child assumes it is true. At that point, if information in the article is changed, or worse, the whole article is deleted by an editor or admin, then the child is being told explicitly ‚Äúwhat you thought was true about this entity is not ture‚Äù. In these scenarios, the presence in the Knowledge Vault is likely to be lost and the Knowledge Panel is likely to disappear. Worse, it is 10 times harder to build back the understanding and confidence of the child that is Google once a hugely trusted source has indicated that the information about the entity wasn‚Äôt true.
Building sufficient confidence in Google‚Äôs ‚Äúmind‚Äù generally takes 2 years of work. It can be MUCH faster, but that depends on the amount of authoritative references and press - ironically both are proof of ‚Äúnotability‚Äù for Wikipedia :)
A Knowledge Graph confidence score of 500 or more is the ‚Äúsafety level‚Äù you are looking for. That more or less guarantees that a huge shock like the deletion of a Wikipedia page won‚Äôt ‚Äúkill‚Äù the entity and the Knowledge Panel. Google has sufficient confidence in its understanding to ignore Wikipedia. 
When you get to this stage, you have got a place in the Knowledge Vault, Google understands the strong relationships with other Entities in the Knowledge Vault, it is supremely confident that the information it has understood is factual and reliable‚Ä¶ And all of that is centered on your Entity Home that you own and control. 
Creating that loop of self confirming corroboration with your Entity Home as the hub is your control. If you can get that right, then updating or adding information becomes relatively simple. Just bear in mind that this process is generally slower than the more traditional SEO. Weeks and months, rather than days. 
Your Knowledge Panel is now yours.
I hope you enjoyed the course and learned a lot. I certainly learned a lot researching and writing it. It took me 10 years to get here. And pretty much everything I have learned from the successes and failures over those years is in this course. I put in the 20,000 hours so you don‚Äôt have to.
Everything here is aimed at helping you to avoid my mistakes and get straight to the successes for your entity as efficiently as possible.
You now know how to educate the child that is Google. Enjoy being the parent in the room :)
Thank you. And see you soon I hope."
Explanation of How Google Chooses What Photos and Logos to Show	"In this lesson I‚Äôll cover how to add, change photos and logos in a Knowledge Panel and also how to add more.
The first, easy idea is to change a photo or a logo through the ‚Äúsuggest an edit‚Äù button. Once you've claimed the Knowledge Panel. They will sometimes accept your request for adding one or more images or even changing an image. However, this isn‚Äôt very common unless there is a mixup and they have the wrong person or logo showing. 
I would imagine that having your preferred photo in the Knowledge Panel is fairly low on the list of priorities Google sets for the people who are dealing with suggested edits and updating the Knowledge Panels.
And always remember that the algorithms always have the final say. If the human being changes the photo in the drawer labeled as photo, or adds an additional drawer with a photo, the algorithms can always remove it and replace that image with one it feels is more representative and / or useful and helpful to the searcher. 
So, the question I need to answer for you is ‚Äúhow do the algorithms choose the images for Knowledge Panels‚Äù.
First thing to point out is that Google will often use the image it finds on Wikipedia. Not always, as this example of Yoast shows.

For the rest, you need to think in image groups and dominant images. 

Making firm decisions about which images you want plus consistency on first, second and third party sites are key.
Starting with a logo is easiest. Here we can see that there are 4 different logos

Group 1 is the dominant group. The logo from that group will be used. So far, so simple.
Use the same logo everywhere from your site to your social channels and in your press kit so third party websites get it right. 
For companies, Google generally only shows one image and that is the dominant logo.
Now, for people, as you can imagine this gets more complicated, and the concept of a dominant group and the dominant photo in each group is vital.
Firstly, the algorithms look for recognisable images. That means illustrations rarely work, photos with the face half covered, or with clown makeup are generally also a no-go.
The main photo will be the dominant photo in the dominant group. Google uses this as the thumbnail:

The row of images just below are the dominant images from each of 5 different image groups. In this case, they are the 6 top ranking images. They are the most representative for Joost de Valk. 
I used this example because, although Yoast as a company communicates heavily using the illustrations of their team, and the illustration of Joost is probably the most common image of him across the web, Google doesn‚Äôt use it. 

Now, let‚Äôs take a look at mine. I have the same photo in all 6 spots. Look closely and you‚Äôll see it is the same photo with different backgrounds and formats. 
Google sees the square one as a different group to the round one, the blue background creates another group, the red background another and the Yoast presentation another. Look closely at Joost and there is a duplicate there too. 

Also important is that Google will generally prioritize the photos that represent the person as they are today. 
If you want to appear younger than you really are, then you‚Äôll need to work hard to keep more recent photos away from Google :)
Internationally, Google will use different photos too - the dominance of groups of photos changes from region to region. 
In France, for example, the photo of me in a brown shirt is more prominent and so shows in my Knowledge Panel in France, even if I search in English! 
This is because I used this image on dozens of platforms in France. I have removed many, but not all. In order to remove that image I would need to do an almost total removal, or add the other images to more third party sites in France.

This is just one photo. For famous people who are regularly photographed, the photos can vary significantly from country to country. 
In general it will be harder to control the photos in the Knowledge Panel of famous people who are often photographed. 
In this case, if you really focus on dominant groups of photos, each with a dominant photo, you can definitely get some influence.
The approach to creating the dominant groups and dominant photos in those groups is pretty simple. But the need for planning and consistency makes it very difficult to get right.
You need to create groups, each with a dominant image, and then spread them around the web on first, second and third party sites. 
You can have a group with only one photo. 
You can use the same photo and change the background or format to create additional groups with the same photo. 
You can have several different photos, each in its own group. 
The key is to ensure that you identify groups and make one group dominant, then ensure that within each group, one photo from that group is obviously dominant.
Do that by volume of appearances across the web, by strategically placing photos on more or less authoritative third party sites and your own distribution of first and second party sites. 
So, as with Image Boxes for your Brand SERP, you need to have the photos on multiple first, second and third party websites. 
Google will then evaluate dominance by frequency of occurrences of both groups and individual photos in those groups, whilst taking into account other factors such as authority and relevance of the host sites, but additionally the meta data in the photos, and other traditional SEO signals. 
SEO techniques such as alt tags, titles, semantic HTML5 and so on will help with the grouping of the photos since they help the bot 
- please watch the Rich Elements course for more about optimizing images for Brand SERPs, and by extension, Knowledge Panels. 
I am not forgetting the Entity Home. 
Here you need to present the dominant photo of each group both in the page and in Schema Markup. 
The Entity Home is very powerful. Once Google has identified the Entity Home then photos that appear on that page will be seen as the entity‚Äôs own suggestion of preferred photos. 
The photo nearest the top of the page will be seen as the ‚Äúsuggested dominant photo‚Äù and will be given priority. 
I have mentioned that, even if it is a struggle to set up
Schema markup if you are not a geek, it is well worth the effort to add Schema for the entity to the Entity Home. 
This Schema should contain a list of images that you want Google to use - a list of ‚Äúsuggested dominant photos‚Äù. 
That said, whatever you suggest on the Entity Home, if evidence around the web shows different dominance, then the Knowledge Panel will display that. 
That means you need to do the work to be consistent across the web. 
But bear in mind dominance by occurrence and authority of the host site are the dominant factors. 
A quick word about company logos. 
That is obviously about the consistency of the logo on first, second and third party websites, plus the Entity Home, Schema markup. 
Since Google only chooses one, that is much simpler. Consistency is key. But then that should be the case in your brand strategy anyway :)
For other Entity Types, the rules of engagement can be very different and you will have no control, or only indirect influence. 
Some are even ‚Äúone-shot-wonders‚Äù where you absolutely HAVE to get it right the first time.
For a Book in the Google Books Vertical, Google will show the cover and some inside pages. 
This is not something you can influence or change.
For a Podcast, it will display the show cover as defined in your podcast feed.
For a Music album it will show the cover, when Google can find it on Spotify, Deezer, MusicBrainz or similar.
In all these cases, it seems probable that, if not today, in the future, by creating multiple image groups with a dominant image for each group,
Google will expand and show more variety and when it does, ideally you will have done the groundwork and Google will show the images you want.
Thank you !"
Explanation of How to Manage People Also Search For and Related Searches in Your Google Knowledge Panel	"People also search for and related searches. 
Unfortunately, these are almost impossible to control or even significantly influence. This lesson contains mostly an explanation of how they work, and the tips and techniques we currently know.
We are working hard analysing the data in Kalicube Pro and doing experiments to see how we can better exert influence over these two Knowledge Elements on the SERP. 
The results for People Also Search For (PASF) and Related Searches are often different. 
Google recently changed the dropdown result from the search box from Related Searches to People Also Search For, but for the moment, in order to distinguish them I will use Related Searches. 
Now, that change in name MAY be a signal that they are going to merge the results, or perhaps use the same algorithm, or perhaps even change the layout of the SERP.
I‚Äôll need to re-record this lesson in a year or so when we see what Google does and at Kalicube we have figured out exactly how this works. Exciting :)
I‚Äôll also talk about what we call ‚ÄúEntity Boxes‚Äù. At the bottom of some Brand SERPs Google includes entity-based Related Searches like these three for the Beatles.

Right now, they are obviously driven by different algorithms. 
Related Searches is more web-index, cross-search volume, and name similarity based and 
the People Also Search For and Entity Boxes are more Knowledge Graph and category / ontology based. 
But it appears all those factors - and more - are used in the different algorithms, they are just weighted differently.
Firstly, Related Searches in the dropdown menu. When looking at the results for myself and multiple experiments we have done - NOT a large data set, but enough to make a good educated guess, in related searches, Google seems to be looking more at the closeness, strength and duration of the relationship. In this case, my sister and my mother are close, strong and long.
Jason Bernard is included due to the similarity in the names since there is no other meaningful relationship between us. 
Kalicube is included principally due to cross-search volume - a large number of people who search Jason Barnard will also search ‚ÄùKalicube‚Äù at some point.
Samantha Weinberg is included because she has a parallel career as a fiction writer using the pseudonym ‚ÄúKate Westbrook‚Äù. 
Rand Fishkin is included due to cross-searches, but also because I focussed on communicating my (admittedly distant) relationship with Rand when I started rebuilding my Knowledge Panel from scratch after my Wikipedia page was deleted - that‚Äôs a long story, and was a HUGE learning experience - but that story is for another day :)

The point here really is that Related Searches are about offering both disambiguation options and research opportunities. 
You cannot influence the disambiguation entities - in this case Jason Bernard - except by potentially convincing Google that there is no ambiguity. 
Increasing the search volume on the correct name here would be a solution. 
The influence you have here is always indirect and 
you can‚Äôt aim for anything very specific. 
Educating Google about strong, close and long-lasting relationships with known entities and demonstrating their value to your audience is the technique. 
For example I could work to improve Google‚Äôs understanding of my relationship to my other sister, who is a writer. She could potentially be a candidate to replace Samantha Weinberg. 
From a professional perspective, I could work on educating Google more about a long term business partner, or companies I have founded. 
With Rand Fishkin, I made more online ‚Äúnoise‚Äù about the Kalicube Tuesdays with him than the other guests, mentioning him in my entity description and generally ensuring Google clearly sees the relationship repeatedly. 
Whether there is truly cause and effect here is debatable. We are still figuring this out at Kalciube, but this seems like a good start :)
Ironically, People Also Search For is more heavily weighted towards similar entities using ontologies. So in fact it seems to me that Google is using a misnomer here - these are less People Also Search For and more ‚ÄúRelated Searches‚Äù :)
In my case, as of late 2022, the PASF are other digital marketers, which makes sense from an Entity Equivalent standpoint.
In this specific case, geo doesn‚Äôt apply since digital marketing is an international occupation by definition. However, for most companies and people, these will vary from country to country and you‚Äôll see the Entity Equivalent aspect more clearly - same entity type, same geo region and same industry :) 
There probably is some crossover of searches - people who search my name probably also search Rand Fiskin, Joost de Valk, Cindy Krum or Lily Ray, but it is Entity Equivalence that is the main driving factor here.
A good illustration of this is that when the subtitle in my Knowledge Panel was ‚ÄúMusician‚Äù, the PASF were Boowa and Kwala as a music group, and three other musical artists.
I didn‚Äôt keep a screenshot of the Google SERP from that time. Luckily, Kalicube Pro tracks my Brand SERP and Knowledge Panel so I have data going back several years. 
The other musical artists have no connection to me, or even my previous musical career - which was music for children and French Alternative Punk Folk. 

So People Also Search For in the Knowledge Panel is very much ontological and would be more appropriately referred to as ‚Äúontologically relations searches‚Äù or, in Kalicube-speak - close Entity Equivalents.
Obviously this is just one example. It is very illustrative and helpful. We have experiments that show the same general pattern and I look at Brand SERPs all day, every day, and I see these same distinctions between Related Searches and People Also Search For all the time. 
In this example with Google‚Äôs own Brand SERP, we can see the geo-differences in both related Searches and in PASF. The PASF shows the geo aspect of Entity Equivalents - Google‚Äôs perception of the equivalent for a searcher in the US is different to that for a searcher in Australia.


Once interesting ‚Äúquirk‚Äù in People Also Search For is ‚Äútrending‚Äù. 
Google will sometimes temporarily promote an Equivalent Entity when search volume for that Equivalent Entity spikes. 
Here is an example. There is nothing you can do to influence trending entities appearing in your PASF, however, to appear as trending in the PASF for other Entity Equivalents, you simply need to create a spike in searches on the name.

To influence what appears in People Also Search For in a Knowledge Panel is, once again, 
using your entity home, 
Entity Description and 
corroborative sources 
to insist on relationships with specific Entity Equivalents. 
Getting multiple relevant, authoritative third parties to mention your entity in a semantic triple with a specific Entity Equivalent is certainly going to help. 
Multiple repetitions of the semantic triple ‚ÄúJason Barnard works with Andrea Volpini '' on first, second and third party sites would increase the probability.
Andrea appears in my PASF since he is also in the digital marketing industry.
In fact, two years ago he WAS in my PASF - once again, cause and effect is difficult to establish but that was during a period when his company, Wordlift started sponsoring my podcast and we both appeared on several popular webinars and online conferences.
The last item here is Entity Boxes, which are part of Related Searches at the bottom of the Brand SERP. 
This example for the Beatles shows an obvious ontological bias. It is aimed at taking the searcher on a research journey. 
A little like Knowledge Panel Hopping, but with Entity Boxes :) 
But games aside, Google adds these Entity Boxes whenever it has a sufficiently good understanding of the entity and its context. 
These Entity Boxes are built in a similar manner to People Also Search For. 
The algorithm is very similar, perhaps even the same, except that it finds a related topic and shows Entity Equivalents from that topic.


To trigger and manage these you‚Äôll need to take educating Google to ‚Äúthe next level‚Äù beyond Knowledge Panels.
In fact, for all three of these SERP Elements, for any level of control, 
you‚Äôll need to establish 
a very solid understanding of your entity and 
its relationships to other entities, including topic Entities. 
Having said I‚Äôd have to re-record this lesson in the future, I now see I will need to research fully, and create a whole course about building your mini-Knowledge Graph as a sub-section that is included in Google‚Äôs own Knowledge Vault. 
At Kalicube, we will soon build a system to analyze these patterns and figure out how to do exactly that and gain more control over related entities in Brand SERPs."
Explanation of How to Get your Knowledge Panel to Trigger on Your Brand SERP	"As we‚Äôve seen, many entities have Knowledge Panels, but it does not trigger on a Brand SERP. Question is, how to get your Knowledge Panel to show on your Brand SERPs.
First case is that if there is absolutely no ambiguity, i.e. the name is totally unique, then the problem you need to solve is Google‚Äôs confidence in the understanding it has. That requires Kalicube‚Äôs 3 step process plus some good PR with relevant third party articles about the entity. 
There might also be an issue with the amount of information it has. If Google has only the name and subtitle, for example, adding the Knowledge Panel to the SERP brings no additional value to the searcher. In that situation Google will generally not show the Panel. Even with a photo, this is usually the case, since Google will add image boxes in the Left Rail to cover this. The solution here is to add additional attributes and a description. Look at the information that Google includes for Entity Equivalents, and add that information to your Entity Home and other profiles, then wait for Google to crawl, and give the Knowledge algorithm a month or two to digest the information so it can generate a ‚Äúmicro featured snippet‚Äù, as I like to call the information snippets in a Knowledge Panel.
If you have ticked those first two boxes for Google - confidence in its fundamental understanding of the Entity and the quantity of relevant information it can show - look at relevancy, especially geo relevancy. Even with a unique name, an entity that only serves an audience in the US is not relevant to an audience in Finland. In that situation, in FInland Google might not show the Knowledge Panel. Generally speaking, you CAN trigger your irrelevant Knowledge Panel in Finland, Fiji and France by building Google‚Äôs confidence to the point it will display the Knowledge Panel purely to ‚Äúshow off‚Äù. I strongly advise building Google‚Äôs confidence as much as possible over several years for every entity you are working on for reasons of stability, visibility in different Rich SERP Elements such as Carousels, Entity Boxes and Related Searches. But don‚Äôt do it just to show your Knowledge Panel to people who cannot use your services - focus on doing things that help you improve your brand on Google for your REAL audience :)
Now, when there is ambiguity and Google has multiple Knowledge Panels competing for that spot, including Google Business Profiles, then the algorithm needs to decide which is the most relevant and helpful. Google calls this the dominant Entity. 
Which Entity is dominant depends on many factors including: 1) The popularity of the entity - a film star will tend to dominate over a business owner, for example 2) Google‚Äôs perception of the intent of the specific user, for example within a search session, the series of searches made by the user might suggest that the business person IS the entity the user is interested in rather than the film star 3) the geo-relevancy - the dominant Mary Moore in the US is the actress, in the UK the dominant Mary Moore is Henry Moore‚Äôs daughter 4) Google‚Äôs confidence in its understanding, for example I am the dominant Entity for ‚ÄúJason Barnard‚Äù around the world purely through this technique - pure confidence 5) The amount of information Google has to show about the Entity - a richer Knowledge Panel would have a slight advantage over a less complete one.
Generally speaking the one to focus on most is the popularity, as measured by search volume and references around the web on authoritative sources. This then means it is significantly more probable that the user is looking for this entity. Probability is HUGE for Google as a deciding factor in the choice for any element on a SERP. If you are competing against a popular entity, then focus on your geo region first and spread out. Build local PR: your solution here is to become more relevant to users searching in your town than the star :) -When building that PR, be sure to add each new article about you to your website with a link to the article and a brief summary. Each of these articles should have a dedicated webpage on your site - so you will build a ‚Äúnews‚Äù section and gradually fill it with these highly geo-relevant articles that will build up Google‚Äôs perception of the probability people in that region are searching for you. From here, if you want a Knowledge Panel nationally, you need to work out little by little by reiterating this process in other towns and relevant national news outlets. Good luck with that.
For people there is a huge problem with ambiguity since many people share the same name. There are over 300 Jason Barnard‚Äôs in the world - a footballer in South Africa, a Hockey player in Canada, a professor at Golden Gate university, a podcaster in the UK, an actor, and multiple digital marketers in several countries‚Ä¶ I have managed to dominate worldwide purely by confidence in understanding, a strong Entity Home, consistent information around the web and a constant stream of relevant digital PR. I have it relatively easy, Mary Moore, Simon Cox and Robert Smith all have tougher jobs than I with dominance. 
For a person, one solution is to rebrand yourself. Add a middle initial, or even your full middle name. This reduces ambiguity massively. ‚ÄúJason M Barnard‚Äù would reduce the field of competition significantly. ‚ÄúJason Martin Barnard‚Äù would reduce it to just a few. You could also add an associated word ‚ÄúMark Preston SEO‚Äù, for example‚Ä¶. Or switch to a nickname ‚ÄúJase ‚Äòthe bass‚Äô Barnard‚Äù would work if my main career was as a musician. As a company, you may choose to change your brand name entirely. 
Because of trademarks and company registrations, company names tend to be less ambiguous than for people, so the problem is generally smaller.
For books, films, music albums, music groups, products and other entities it is a good idea to consider ambiguity in your decision when choosing a name. If the entity is already named and is public, then you either work for dominance or rebrand.
If you DO change the name of a Person, a Company or other Entity - even if only very slightly by adding a middle initial or changing the company brand from ‚ÄúBrooke‚Äôs‚Äù to ‚ÄúBrooke‚Äôs Bros‚Äù, for example - then you need to treat it's a complete rebrand, and so expect the process to last a year or more. You would need to change every major reference to the entity on first, second and third party sites - consistency here is absolutely the key - but you would also need to communicate extensively with your audience so that they search the new name. Google pays a lot of attention to that. One advantage is that a rebranding gives you an excuse to communicate and get mentions, links and articles, all of which will help with the Knowledge Panel, and indeed your business.
There is no need to change domain name - in fact that would often be a mistake since it would set you back several steps in terms of Google‚Äôs understanding of you. Same thing for social media. The actual handle or URL makes little difference. What DOES make a difference is that Google has already started to associate you with your website and social accounts, whether you have a Knowledge Panel now or not. 
You DO need to change every reference on the official site, every reference on any first, second or third party sites and update your Schema markup, using the alternateName field to explicitly remind Google that BOTH versions of the name refer to that entity. Finding all those references is a huge task. Please look in the additional materials where we have a case study about how to do that.
https://kalicube.com/case-studies/compiling-a-digital-ecosystem-manually-vs-kalicube-pro/
One thing to look out for on the Brand SERP when you are working from a position of no Knowledge Panel or being dominated by another Entity is ‚ÄúSee Results About‚Äù. 
If you get a See Results About without a Knowledge Panel for your Entity on the Brand SERP, then Google lacks confidence in its understanding. It is also possible that it is lacking enough information. So just click on the See Results About and take a look. If the Knowledge Panel on that SERP contains information your audience would find helpful, then work on confidence (aka PR and links to the Entity Home). If there isn‚Äôt much information in that Knowledge Panel, then work on providing more information and corroborating it. 
In a case where there are multiple entities vying for position and none has obvious dominance, Google will simply show multiple See Results About like this. 

You‚Äôll notice that I took screenshots from three locations. The entities are not the same in each three locations.
Geo-relevancy is also incredibly important. Right now, Google often gets this ‚Äúwrong‚Äù. It will show a Google Business Profile for a local business from the US on a SERP in France, for example. However, it is getting this increasingly more ‚Äúright‚Äù. 
But as you can see here the dominant entity can vary enormously.



And then some entities are truly dominant. Like Robert Smith.

As a quick aside, take a VERY close look. You‚Äôll notice some differences that are due to the geo-location. Aside from the People Also Search For, in the Uk, the fact that Blackpool is in the Uk is implicit, so Google shows simple ‚ÄúBlackpool‚Äù. In the US his height is given in feet and inches, rather than metres and centimetres. Small differences, I know, but it demonstrates that Google adapts and even the most solid and dominant Knowledge Panels will vary according to geo.
Back to how to get your Knowledge Panel to show: If you are competing against a dominant Entity that is irrelevant to your geo-region then you need to focus on 1) getting a Knowledge Panel if you don‚Äôt have one, 2) building confidence in Google‚Äôs mind and 3) enriching your Knowledge Panel so that Google has something useful and helpful to show. 
 If you are competing against an Entity that is relevant to your geo-region, or is dominant like Robert Smith, then once you have a Knowledge Panel you need to work hard on localized PR - mention and links to your Entity Home from authoritative third party sites that are geo-relevant. Start by getting the Knowledge Panel to trigger in the town where the Entity is most relevant, then move to state or county level, then country. The trick is to build outwards from the place where the likelihood that the searcher is looking for that entity is highest and build your PR geographically outwards from there.
Also note that news cycles can affect Knowledge Panels. If there is a huge news story around a namesake - a court case or celebrity marriage or major acquisition, for example - then that Entity will often become dominant during the period of time the world is focussing on that, and then things will usually go back to how they were when the news has died down. Don‚Äôt panic here, though! Generally speaking, only BIG news stories that are covered by highly authoritative and relevant media will have this effect. 
We now have three aspects to work on for dominance: confidence in understanding, helpfulness of the information Google has to display and geo-notability.
Once you have established the Entity Home, written a great description, done the spring clean of first, second and third party corroborative sources,  and signposted all of this with or without Schema, then a well-focussed and highly relevant digital PR campaign is the key. 
Bear in mind that dominance is something you need to attain, and then maintain over time. Google is constantly evolving and improving, so things can change unexpectedly if you aren‚Äôt working on understanding, information and geo-notability. 
A fatal mistake a great many people make is to trigger the Knowledge Panel on the Brand SERP and think ‚Äújob done‚Äù. In those cases, the Knowledge Panel will be unstable and likely to be removed when Google updates its algorithms. Believe me, this happens a lot. You have to build up confidence, information and geo-notability over time, and you need to maintain an up-to-date Entity home, description, consistent corroboration around the web on first, second and third party sites and maintain up-to-date schema markup and or link-based ‚Äúsignposting‚Äù.
And finally, always retain a realistic ambition in terms of Knowledge Panel presence on a Brand SERP. Look at the ‚Äúcompetition‚Äù and set yourself realistic targets, goals and timelines."
Explanation of Google's Knowledge Vault Algorithm Works an how to get Your Entity Into Google's Main Knowledge Graph	"As you have seen in previous lessons, Google has multiple Knowledge Graph Verticals including Google Books, Google Maps, and the web index. 
Its current problem is that these verticals struggle to ‚Äútalk to each other‚Äù horizontally. They need to use a lookup table with only a small amount of information.
Ultimately, Google needs to merge these Knowledge Verticals into one single Knowledge Vault - the core of Google‚Äôs Knowledge. 
Now because Google Business and Google Maps drive an entire ecosystem that is absolutely fundamental to their business model and services, my educated guess is that this is the last that will be fully merged.
Currently, educational establishments and tourist attractions enjoy a merged presence in both the Knowledge Vault and Google Maps. 
This demonstrates that it can merge, but is not in a position to do so at scale with ANY of the Knowledge Graph Verticals it has.
So, whichever Knowledge Vertical you are dealing with today, the aim is to move the entity into the Knowledge Vault. 
At that point your entity becomes universally accessible and usable by every algorithm, every vertical, and every service.
The kgmid is vital here. It is the unique identifier Google uses for each entity, whatever Knowledge vertical it is in. Whatever you hear anywhere else, this id is absolutely key to Google. 
You must use it as a reference to your entity in your schema markup. There have been rumours that you shouldn‚Äôt use this as a reference. 
You definitely SHOULD, at least for Google. 
It doesn‚Äôt mean anything to the other bots, but to Google it is a centralised reference to a named Entity and the only way for all the verticals to communicate. 
A quick aside on de-duplicating. Google often triggers multiple Knowledge Graph entries for the same Entity - generally this is because the Entity has been identified in different verticals and so each one triggers a kgmid. Sometimes, but not often, one vertical will duplicate. 
You can vastly help Google deduplicate by adding BOTH kgmid to the schema markup on the Entity Home. 
This allows it to reconcile the two in the lookup table and then either it will delete one and keep the other, or it will merge the two , as you can see here for my duplicates.

 Once Google trusts the Entity Home as the authority on the entity, then deduplicating really is as simple as adding the two references to your Schema on the Entity Home.
The truth is that Google - and indeed Bing - are working to centralize Knowledge and centralize the use of that Knowledge for all their algorithms and services. Ali Alvi, who is project leader for the Featured Snippet algorithm at Bing, is the person who explained this to me. Obviously, once you know, I know :) 
So, although Google manages to build ‚Äúpseudo Knowledge‚Äù on the SERP in the form of its different curated Vertical Knowledge Graphs, outside the Knowledge Vault everything else is peripheral, indirect and temporary.
Moving your entity from whatever vertical that is currently triggering the Knowledge Panel and into the Knowledge vault is key. 
Not only for Knowledge Panels, but also Google Search and every other Google service you might want to leverage.
As with everything worth doing it is worth doing well, and is it worth bearing in mind that it will take time.
Let‚Äôs look at the time factor. Why is Google‚Äôs Knowledge Vault relatively slow compared to results in the web index? 
Google is trying to build one centralized source of fundamental knowledge. 
They have multiple human curated Knowledge Verticals and it would seem simple to move those into the Knowledge Vault.
But there are HUGE problems. 
If the algorithm moves, say, an author from the Google Books vertical to the main Knowledge Graph / Knowledge Vault, the explicit connection between the author and their books will be lost. Google Books is human curated. 
The Knowledge Vault is 100% Machine Learning, so the transfer from human logic to machine logic is not linear and simple. 
Whatever the vertical, the Knowledge Vault is adding entities all the time. 
The trick for Google is not to duplicate. In the case of Google Books, once the algorithm for the Knowledge Vault has confidently understood an author, it will use the lookup table and appropriate that author for itself, taking over from Google Books as the foundational source. 
The problem there is pretty obvious. The books are left behind, and even if the books are in the Knowledge Vault, the connection is not there. 
Towards the end of 2021 Kalicube Data of over 2000 authors showed that many had been moved into the Knowledge Vault, but their books were not.
That meant that in the Knowledge Panel, the author still appeared, buit the books were no longer included in the Knowledge Panel. 
This is a specific example, but it shows how this is going to work over the coming years. 
As Google‚Äôs global knowledge algorithm becomes confident about its understanding about a named entity, it will move individual entities from the different verticals into the Knowledge Vault, but it will not necessarily move the connected entities with it. And we have seen at Kalicube that even if it does move them at the same time, it almost always loses the connection.
In the case of Google Books, Google generally moves the author alone. 
In that case the connection to the books is lost in both Google‚Äôs understanding but also in the Knowledge Panel. 
Even when Google moves both the books and the authors from the Google Books vertical into the main Knowledge Graph vertical at the same.
The connection between them is usually lost because the Google Books vertical was hard coded with human curated relationships, whereas the Knowledge Vault has no hard coding at all. It is being built purely with machine learning, so no human has direct control. 
That is both scary and reassuring :)
Now, let‚Äôs look at a problem. If you remember from the ‚ÄúChest of Drawers‚Äù analogy, each Knowledge Graph vertical independently adds new entities to that lookup table as it creates them. 
Since the verticals, including the Knowledge Vault, only communicate through this lookup table, you can see there are immense opportunities for duplicates of a named entity. This happens A LOT. 
As Google moves entities from the verticals into the Knowledge Vault it is creating large numbers of duplicates. This is a HUGE problem for Google, which explains why it appears to be moving slowly.
It is also a huge problem for us since we need to keep track of those duplicates and ensure that we move our entities smoothly from the vertical they are in - be it Books, Podcasts, Scholar, Images or the Web Index - into the Knowledge Vault and, ideally, move all the connected entities with it.
The example of Google Books is great for that. 
When Google moves an author from the Google Books vertical into the Knowledge Vault, it will generally ‚Äúleave the books behind‚Äù. We can actively work to ensure that it moves the books and the author at the same time and retains the relationships.
As always that requires, 
Kalicube‚Äôs 3 step process - Entity Home, description and consistent first, second and third party corroboration. In this case for the author and every single one of his or her books. AT THE SAME TIME.
Remember Google Books, Podcasts and so on have relationships hard coded into them. 
When you move into the Knowledge Vault nothing is hard coded. It is up to you to create those relationships in the Knowledge Vault, and the work to create those relationships is ALWAYS indirect. 
That said, once you have managed it, the relationship is arguably more solid than in the human curated vertical, and DEFINITELY more effective in terms of brand visibility in Google.
Generally speaking, it is super important to remember that Google will not add information to the Knowledge Vault if it isn't confident. 
And once it has added an entity and related information to the Knowledge Vault it has a measurement of confidence in that information.
This is hugely understandable. 
As the machine learns to learn, it will learn faster and faster‚Ä¶ Google needs to minimize the errors at the base today since those will be VASTLY amplified as the algorithms grow.
From a practical perspective, it is absolutely essential that we get our entities into the Knowledge Vault. 
Triggering a Knowledge Panel with Google Books, or Google Podcasts or even the Web Index Vertical is fine. It looks good. But it is superficial, so you should never stop there. 
You need to move that entity into the Knowledge Vault. 
And then you need to build Google's confidence in its understanding of that Entity - and every detail about that entity - 
so that your entity can get a solid, reliable and permanent Knowledge Panel, but also gain prominence in every single Google algorithm and every Google service from search to Discover to Gmail to Maps.
Now, Google has two ways of using entities within their search algorithms. 
The first, most obvious is the Knowledge Vault, the multiple Knowledge Graph verticals and the kgmid lookup table we have discussed. 
Now, a HUGE aspect of what Google chooses to add to its Knowledge vault and also what it chooses to show in Knowledge Panels is Google‚Äôs understanding through the web index. 
Here we are looking at how Google understands the pages it crawls. Your owned pages being the most important.
HTML tables, 
lists, 
Schema Markup and in my experience, most importantly, 
Natural Language Processing of your copywriting. 
Solid HTML structure, 
clear copywriting and 
corroboration 
are the simple steps you need to get Google to understand your entity, 
move it to the Knowledge Vault and 
show a meaningful, truthful and manageable Knowledge Panel built of micro Featured Snippets - as I explained in a previous lesson.
The last topic of this lesson is ‚Äúwhy is this all so slow?‚Äù
With the web index we have become accustomed to daily or weekly updates. Think back to the Google Dance. 
Google deals with data rivers and data lakes. 
The web index and the SERP results currently run on a process of data rivers whereby Googlebot crawls the web page,
the data flows by the ranking algorithm 
and the ranking algorithm can recalibrate itself more or less in real time using the stream of data provided by GoogleBot.
In the days of the Google Dance, Google worked on a system of data lakes‚Ä¶ 
GoogleBot would crawl the web, store the data in a lake and the SERP algorithm would only look into the Data Lake and update every few months. 
As such, search results would be very static for several months and then massively change when the SERP algorithm updated with the data lake. 
The Knowledge Vault is currently in the data lake scenario, so you need to be patient. 
That said, the intermediary of the ‚Äúchest of drawers‚Äù analogy shows that in terms of what Google is displaying in Knowledge Panels, we are closer to the Data River than we are to the Data Lake.
HOWEVER the foundational understanding that Google uses to trigger a Knowledge Panel, especially from the Knowledge Vault, remains part of the Data Lake approach. 
Bear that in mind when working to trigger a Knowledge Panel. 
And bear in mind the data river approach when trying to manage the contents of a Knowledge Panel over time. 
This is what we do all day every day at Kalicube using the Kalicube Pro SaaS platform :)
Thanks for watching. See you soon, I hope."
Explanation of Google's Knowledge Panel Algorithm and how Google builds Knowledhe Panels	"One thing that is often overlooked is how Google builds a Knowledge Panel. As we have seen, a presence in the Knowledge Vault or one of the Knowledge Graph verticals is the starting point. Each of these verticals, including the Knowledge Vault attributes a kgmid to the entity. That kgmid is unique for each entity. 
So Jason Barnard -me - has the kgmid /g/11cm_q3wqr Jason Barnard who teaches at the Golden Gate University has the kgmid /g/11l48kvhjg and Jason Barnard, the actor in the film ‚ÄúFirst Man‚Äù has the kgmid /g/11fw71_nbj 
Bill Slawski mentioned to me a couple of years ago that a Google patent indicates that there is a centralized lookup table with these ids so that all the algorithms can access them. The lookup table contains the id and the name.
Each Knowledge Graph vertical adds new entities to that lookup table as it creates them. That isn‚Äôt much information. Each Vertical Knowledge Graph contains much more information than that and they use that additional information in their algorithms - both the podcasts, books, maps verticals - and also the Rich Elements in the SERPS they provide - Podcast Boxes, Image Boxes, Map Packs etc
Previously, I've talked about the fact that Knowledge Panels are triggered by vertical Knowledge Graph. But when building the SERP, the whole page algorithm is using the lookup table too. So it has the kgmid, the name and knows which vertical provided the entity. 
As with all the other Rich Elements on a SERP, there is a dedicated algorithm for a Knowledge Panel, that builds the Panel and then submits it to the Whole Page Algorithm.
If you haven‚Äôt already, please do read my article about Darwinism in Search and my article about the Whole Page Algorithm since those will help you understand how the SERP fits together:
https://jasonbarnard.com/digital-marketing/articles/articles-by/darwinism/
https://jasonbarnard.com/digital-marketing/articles/articles-by/how-bings-whole-page-algorithm-works/
How does it build the panel? I‚Äôm going to use a chest of drawers analogy. The kgmid plus name is a reference to a chest of drawers containing information about the named entity. My chest of drawers is called ‚Äú/g/11cm_q3wqr Jason Barnard‚Äù.
The chest of drawers has multiple small drawers each of which contains a piece of information about the named Entity. The Knowledge Graph Vertical the entity comes from adds drawers with labels and fills the drawers with the information it has. For example a person might have a set of drawers that contains a description, photos, date of birth, net worth, squad number, role in a film. A company might have a founding date, founders, subsidiaries, revenues, logo and so on.
At this point, the Knowledge Panel algorithm could simply build a Knowledge Panel for the entity from the information in each drawer. You‚Äôd think the story stops there and that this lesson is over. Absolutely not!
There are multiple vital aspects to understand before I continue. Hold onto your hat, this gets complicated very quickly. But once you‚Äôve got the idea, it is very simple, and incredibly powerful when managing Knowledge Panels. In fact, it is absolutely fundamental to managing, enhancing and correcting Knowledge Panels, so stick with me here.
Firstly, some drawers are locked and cannot be changed by human beings: the entity name, the id and the Entity Home. The contents of most of the others can be changed and more drawers can be added using data from the web index. However, as we will see, depending on the Knowledge Vertical there can be additional drawers that are locked for the web index, but these CAN be changed by human beings at Google. 
Looking at my Knowledge Panel, the Entity Home - represented by the world icon - is locked. The description is locked since it comes from Google‚Äôs own human curated Books Knowledge Vertical - I am working on seeing how to replace that with my own description‚Ä¶ but this is another example, as with Wikipedia, of ‚Äúhanding control to a third party‚Äù that is the disadvantage of these ‚Äúeasy wins‚Äù for Knowledge Panels :)
We cannot know for sure for the rest, but it is all in the Knowledge Vault, and I would imagine my date of birth, my partner, my mother are all locked, and the albums and TV shows aren‚Äôt. 
Secondly, the chest of drawers are built on flexible templates of the drawers they should contain. For example a film star would have a templated chest of drawers that includes film roles, a football star would have a template that includes squad number, salary, teams played for etc. And I say flexible since a football star can also be a film star, so a specific chest of drawers could be a mixture of both. It's a modular templated system.
Thirdly, when building the Knowledge Panel, the algorithm will choose only the information that is judged to be actually useful to the searcher. As we have seen in previous lessons, when you go Knowledge Panel hopping, the Knowledge Panel building algorithm will add more information from additional drawers, if it has any.
All of that immediately shows you why you shouldn't focus TOO much on the Knowledge Graphs or the Knowledge Vault for what displays in the Knowledge Panel. As I have mentioned in previous lessons, some Knowledge Graph Verticals have additional locked drawers and limited, or no possibility of additional drawers. As of late 2022, Podcasts are an example of this - unless they are in the Knowledge Vault, the information shown in the Knowledge Panel is ‚Äúlocked‚Äù. 

So, now we have a chest of drawers with multiple drawers containing a piece of information about the entity. At this point, an algorithm using the web index will go through each of the unlocked drawers and assess whether the information is, in fact, true based on the information it has in the web index. If it determines that the web contains sufficient reliable evidence that the fact is wrong, the algorithm will replace the information in the drawer.

An example of this is that in The Knowledge Vault, my subtitle is ‚ÄúMusician‚Äù but in the Knowledge Panel, the subtitle is ‚ÄúAuthor‚Äù. 
When the Knowledge Graph updates, it will replace the information in the subtitle drawer with ‚ÄúMusician‚Äù. That will appear in my Knowledge Panel for a few days, and the web index algorithm will switch it back.

Google‚Äôs Knowledge Graph API doesn‚Äôt give us much insight into the information the Knowledge Vault contains, so it is unclear exactly which pieces of information in which drawers it controls. But, after 7 years tracking, collecting data from Knowledge Panels and the Knowledge Graph API, and cross referencing the data, it is clear that some drawers are filled by the Knowledge Vault - or other Knowledge Verticals - and are locked. I can make very good educated guesses about which drawers are locked on a per template-basis. But that is beyond the scope of this lesson - there are WAY too many different entity types, templates and template combinations.

But the HUGE trick to play here when managing a Knowledge Panel is to get into the Knowledge Vault and add information to it, build its confidence in that information to the point at which it is sufficiently confident to lock the drawer and prevent the web index algorithm overriding it. That takes months, and possibly years to achieve !

 
This explains the volatility of the information in Knowledge Panels when the Knowledge Vault updates. If your information is switching back and forth, then the Knowledge Vault - or other Knowledge Vertical - hasn‚Äôt locked the drawer and the web index is able to override.

In my example - in the Knowledge Vault I am seen as a Musician because I have released 6 music albums and recorded over 100 songs, all of which are in the ‚Äútrunk‚Äù of the Knowledge Vault. Because the information is in the trunk it is VERY difficult to change. However, when I published my book The Fundamentals of Brand SERPs and changed my primary semantic triple to ‚ÄúJason Barnard is an author‚Ä¶‚Äù the web index algorithm disagrees and corrects the information in that drawer. 

Look in the additional materials and you‚Äôll find a link to the Kalicube case study on how I achieved the switch from Musician to Author in the Knowledge Panel.

https://kalicube.com/case-studies/knowledge-panel/how-to-change-a-subtitle-in-google-knowledge-panel/

Note that the description and some other information the Knowledge Vault has taken from Wikipedia is locked. As of late 2022, if the description drawer contains a description from Wikipedia, then it is locked. I expect this to change in the future.

The description drawer is also locked when it comes from Google Podcasts and Google Books. The drawers containing the books written by the author are NOT locked, however.

Now, just like the Knowledge Vault, all the Knowledge Verticals will go through the chests of drawers they ‚Äúown‚Äù from time to time and update the information. But, as with the Knowledge Vault, the web index algorithm has the last word on all drawers that these Knowledge Graph Verticals do not lock. 

So, looking at Google Books again, this explains why sometimes books become unattached or lost from Knowledge Panels.

But this process of losing and gaining information in a Knowledge Panel is easy to understand once you have grasped this analogy of a chest of drawers with locked and unlocked drawers filled by the Knowledge Verticals and optionally corrected by the web index.

Two things strike me here. Number one is don‚Äôt panic when information changes, it is either the Knowledge Vertical doing a spring clean, or the web index-driven Knowledge algorithm correcting the information in a drawer, removing a drawer or adding a new drawer.

Generally speaking, with the exception of the locked drawers where the information is truly ‚Äúfixed‚Äù, the rest is pretty flexible and changeable. 

The web index algorithm updates constantly - in the Kalicube Pro database, we see that the contents of Knowledge Panels are volatile. 

The Knowledge Vault also updates constantly, so information about an entity can change from one day to the next, even outside an explicit Knowledge Graph update. New entities are added on a day to day basis. Knowledge graph updates are simply where we see most ‚Äúaction‚Äù. That said, day to day, the Knowledge Vault will only change one percent of entities or less.

Back to the Knowledge Panel. What Google is displaying in a Knowledge Panel is similar to changes in the left rail or in the blue link algorithm. Remember, the aim of the Knowledge Panel is to show the information Google judges to be the information that the searcher would want to see and is designed simply to save the searcher the effort of visiting multiple sites in the Left Rail results. And what Google perceives to be the information that is most helpful will change over time as it understands both more about the entity, but also the points of interest about that entity for its audience. Add to that, Google is constantly in a state of A/B testing‚Ä¶

In short, don't freak out when something changes day to day, since most of the time, it isn't a fundamental change in Google's understanding.

One last point is that Knowledge Panels are geo-sensitive. Although some information is universal across the world, some information is localized such as the customer service number and social media accounts for international corporations. The actual information the Knowledge Panel algorithm chooses to show in different countries can also vary since the audience in one country might have different cultural focuses. The audience in one country might be interested in revenues of the company, another might be more interested in the C-level employees. In these cases, Google adapts the Knowledge Panel country-by country.

So Knowledge Panels are, to a great extent, fluid and change over time along with the web index. They are more or less real time summaries of the facts as understood by the dynamic Knowledge algorithms that use the flow of data in the web index.
A Featured Snippet on Google is a ‚Äúbest guess‚Äù of the most accurate answer to a question. Many elements in a Knowledge Panel work in a similar manner. The algorithm for the Featured Snippet and the algorithms that fill Knowledge Panels with information are close relatives. So, above and beyond the foundational fact that a Knowledge Panel triggers for an Entity because it has been confidently understood by one of Google‚Äôs Knowledge verticals, think of the information in a Knowledge Panel as being a combination of multiple, tiny, featured snippets. 
As you can see from that list, there are three types of questions you need to ask yourself: Number 1, what is Google's foundational understanding, Number 2 which Knowledge Vertical am dealing with, and number 3, what is the dominant information about this in Google's dynamic Web Index .

Last point - I promise - The Entity Home has a special drawer that is locked, and from our experiments, as the Knowledge algorithms see that the information on the Entity Home is correct, over time they build trust for the information provided about the entity by that page and, by extension, that website. This leads to a vastly increased capability to convince these algorithms to add what YOU want to those drawers, and ideally, lock them."
Explanation of Google's Knowledge Extraction Algorithm	"The Knowledge Extraction Algorithm is part of the crawling and indexing process. We can consider that it is part of GoogleBot. 
Googebot discovers, crawls and indexes content. Before it adds content to the index, it breaks that content down into its constituent parts and annotates them. It attempts to identify headings, menus, images, videos, Schema markup and so on so that it can label what type of information it is. When it annotates, it adds a confidence score that indicates its level of confidence that the annotation is correct.

ALL other algorithms that use the web index rely heavily on these annotations to extract information that is relevant for them from the web index. Without these annotations, the other algorithms simply cannot ‚Äúsee‚Äù the information.

That makes this the single most important algorithm to fees since if it can‚Äôt annotate your content, your information is, to all intents and purposes, invisible to the others.

Some web content is structured in a manner that suits the needs of the Knowledge Graph - using Schema.org markup, for example.This explicit and standardised structure is very easy for the algorithms to annotate with a high level of confidence.

When a webpage implements strict Semantic HTML5 correctly - headings, HTML tables for data, lists etc, the data can also be considered structured. In this case it is relatively easy for the algorithms to annotate with a high level of confidence.

When Semantic HTML5 is only partially, or inconsistently used, the data becomes semi structured which helps with annotation and structured indexing but generally leaves the Knowledge Extraction Algorithm with some guess-work. Annotations will be tagged with lower confidence scores.

The vast majority of information Googlebot collects is unstructured, which means the Knowledge Extraction Algorithm needs to make a guess and try to create structure before annotating and adding the information to the web index. Annotations will be tagged with low confidence scores which will penalise them in terms of findability and prioritisation for the other algorithms.

In all cases, Google will use more than just the HTML tagging and Schema - it analyses each chunk of written content using, amongst others, Natural Language Processing, image analysis, video analysis, and many others.

Websites are messier and less well organised than most of us tend to imagine. Although we tend to think that we organise sites, web pages and content systematically and logically, that is rarely the case within one site run by a few people, let alone across billions of sites run by hundreds of millions of people with different approaches, different systems and personal quirks.

So, the algorithm is faced with annotating a huge, inconsistent mess.

Structured Data is obviously a HUGE help to the Knowledge Extraction Algorithm and therefore gives you an advantage. Having messy, unstructured pages with inconsistent headings is a huge disadvantage.

It‚Äôs important to note that the Knowledge Extraction Algorithm is looking at the individual elements of a page - the headings, the menu, the texts, the images, the videos, HTML tables, lists, Schema markup and so on. It is attempting to break the page content down into manageable chunks and accurately annotate each chunk. The aim is for the annotated chunks in the index to provide easy-to-identify pieces that are meaningful and helpful to all the other algorithms: the algorithm for the different results such as the blue links, images, videos, news etc‚Ä¶ and, of course, the other Knowledge Algorithms. 

In a webpage that is spectacularly badly organised, the Knowledge Extraction Algorithm will either not annotate at all or perhaps get the annotation wrong. In any case, if the Knowledge Extraction Algorithm is not confident in its understanding of the information, its role in the page and its structure, it will attribute a low confidence score to the annotation. This is a major disadvantage for that information when being considered by the other algorithms.

Huge point here: without structure annotation, the other Knowledge Algorithms cannot use the data at all. With lower confidence scores on an annotation, the other Knowledge Algorithms are less likely to use that information. 

So you need to make every effort to package your content well for the Knowledge Extraction Algorithm. If you don‚Äôt, your content might not even get into the game.

Giving your content explicit structure using Schema.org markup, HTML tables, headings, sections, etc. becomes fundamentally important to feeding the Knowledge Graph with the facts about and around your Entity. 

So you need to think about what you can do to help the bot understand what role each piece of content on a page plays and - importantly - how far you can push your efforts in order to encourage the Knowledge Extraction Algorithm to attribute a high confidence score to the annotations it gives to important information about the entity. 

For example, the H1 describes the main topic of the page (on the Entity Home, the topic is the entity itself, so the H1 must contain the entity name, obviously), all H2 are sub topics (on the Entity Home, the subtopics are the different aspects of the Entity), the H3 are sub-sub-topics. An ordered list provides steps or assigns relative importance to each point, an unordered list is ‚Äúneutral‚Äù. Alt tags, captions, titles and the on images are a huge help to Googlebot. 

In short use Semantic HTML5 - there are links to two articles about best practices in the additional materials. Some of the techniques these articles explain in detail are: using headings and subheadings correctly, using HTML tables and lists where appropriate, using em tags rather than bold‚Ä¶ and MUCH more.
The most important thing they teach is that you need to disassociate the design from the semantics.
Read the articles and ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù your entity-focussed content to HTML5 

https://jasonbarnard.com/digital-marketing/articles/articles-by/html5-semantic-tags-what-are-they/
https://jasonbarnard.com/digital-marketing/articles/articles-by/semantic-html5-for-content-writers-the-essential-guide/

Any opportunity to provide Googlebot with helpful clues is worth taking. Don‚Äôt shy away from becoming granular - look at your HTML in detail and get rid of every piece that is liable to confuse. Use strict validation to be sure. Potentially add descriptive class names in your css.

Other ways to provide clues and help Googlebot is adding human-corrected subtitles to videos. Or adding chapter markers with titles, and then adding a transcript to the page, using the chapter marker titles as subheadings.

Don‚Äôt forget the basics either. Write clearly using semantic triples, create context clouds. There‚Äôs a PDF download in the additional materials of this lesson that will help you with that.

Use helpful anchor texts on links. This is a huge help since Googlebot is able to digest just one page at a time. The anchor texts allow it to guess what is on the other side - in this case information about the entity. I talk about this more in the lesson about joining the dots in a non-geeky manner. 

Always use Schema markup when possible. Schema markup repeated the contents of the page in a manner that is structured in what I call ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äôs Native Language‚Äù. Imagine that Google‚Äôs Knowledge Algorithm has made a good guess at the contents of the page and has 40% confidence in its educated guess. By providing corroboration on the page itself in Google‚Äôs Native Language, it can attribute a higher confidence score - let‚Äôs say 80% - to annotations the Schema markup supports. Notably, in the context of Knowledge Panels and the Knowledge Vault, it can attribute significantly higher confidence scores to annotations to information that is important to the understanding of the Knowledge Panel and Knowledge Vault Algorithms. 

Now, all of this lesson appears to be focussed on the Entity Home. I recommend that you super-optimise the Entity Home since this is the fulcrum for you and for Google‚Äôs Knowledge Algorithms.

But why stop there? Each and every one of these techniques is well worth taking on all the other pages about the entity you control, as well as second and third party sources. Take every single opportunity where you can help Google‚Äôs Knowledge Extraction Algorithm correctly and confidently annotate information about the entity. It‚Äôs a no-brainer.

Second party corroborations might have limited opportunities for this type of optimization, but take those you can. Look at which of these techniques you can implement on the entity‚Äôs social profiles, human curated databases such as IMDB, Wikipedia, Wikidata, Crunchbase, LinkedIn and so on.

Then reach out to third party sites - articles about the entity, reviews about the entity and so on - and see what you can do there. Obviously you have no control, but that also means that, as long as the source is relevant and authoritative, the information carries more weight in Google‚Äôs algorithms.
So reach out to the person who wrote the information, or controls the webpage and ask them to implement techniques that help the Knowledge Extraction Algorithm. 

As you know, the more confidence Google has in the annotations, the better. And authoritative third party sources carry most weight."
Explanation of The Three Google Knowledge Algorithms	"You now know how a Knowledge Panel is built, which vertical Knowledge Graphs are available to you and how to get into the Knowledge Vault.
Of course, every aspect of the Knowledge Vault, Knowledge Panels and Brand SERPs are managed by Machine Learning Algorithms. In this lesson I will focus on the three Knowledge Algorithms. I‚Äôll explain how they work and what you can do to help them understand your entity. 
I‚Äôd like to make one very obvious but Incredibly important point here - machine Learning algorithms evolve constantly - they are learning to learn, which means they change every time they run and they improve exponentially. Add to that the fact that Google engineers regularly tweak the algorithms and feed them with additional data‚Ä¶ you understand that Knowledge Panels are a constantly moving target and managing them is necessarily an ongoing monthly task.
So, back to Google‚Äôs Knowledge Algorithms. What are they? Where do they intervene? How do they work? And how can we feed them effectively?
Let‚Äôs start with a simple definition: Google has many algorithms that help it understand the world and display that understanding on the SERP to its users in a helpful manner. The Knowledge Algorithms operate on three main levels. One is responsible for curating information for the Knowledge Vault and the Web Index Knowledge Graph, one builds Knowledge Panels and the other assimilates the information from the world wide web to allow the other two to access the information.
Let‚Äôs start with the foundational algorithm - I would suggest the most important - The Knowledge Extraction Algorithm. This Knowledge Algorithm is part of Googlebot and it creates structured data from (mostly) unstructured online content. 

When GoogleBot and BingBot crawl a page, they extract the information from that webpage and attempt to give it structure and annotate the information before putting it in the index. It also attributes a confidence score to the annotation - indicating its level of confidence that the annotation is accurate. 

Always remember that the bot is looking at this page in isolation, so it needs as many helpful clues as possible on the page itself in order to annotate accurately. There is an entire lesson about that in this course.

The Knowledge Panel Algorithm builds Knowledge Panels on Google SERPs. If you haven‚Äôt already done so, watch the lesson about how a Knowledge Panel is built. 

The Knowledge Panel Algorithm determines what can be shown in the Knowledge Panel of an Entity. The role of the Knowledge Panel in a SERP is to provide the user with a summary of factual information about an Entity without having to visit multiple webpages. As such much of the information displayed is found in the pages behind the blue links results. 

In the lesson about the Knowledge Panel Algorithm and how a Knowledge Panel is built, I use a chest of drawers analogy to explain this process, and I also present techniques you can use to manage the contents of Knowledge Panels.

The Knowledge Panel Algorithm populates Knowledge Panels with information from the web index that it considers to be reliable fact. And bear in mind the role the Knowledge Extraction Algorithm plays here. If it has accurately annotated a piece of content, then that information is MUCH more likely to be found by the Knowledge Panel Algorithm. And if the annotation has been attributed a high confidence score by the Knowledge Extraction Algorithm, it is more likely to be considered positively by the Knowledge Panel Algorithm.

As you can now see, the annotation is absolutely vital since without it, the information won‚Äôt even be considered by the other algorithms. And a high confidence score will move that information upwards towards the front of the queue.


The Knowledge Vault Algorithm adds information (hopefully facts) to the Main Knowledge Graph (which I also call the Knowledge Vault).

The ultimate aim for Google is to ‚Äúunderstand the world‚Äù by filling this Knowledge Vault with all the facts about everything. Obviously impossible, but a nice target to aim for. Since Google owns multiple human curated Vertical Knowledge Graphs, one technique it is using is to move the entities from the verticals and into the Knowledge Vault. 

As such, this Knowledge Algorithm is responsible for selecting the entities or information it can move from the different Vertical Knowledge Graphs (Podcasts, Books, Scholar etc), to the Knowledge Vault. 

This process is pure Machine Learning. That means the algorithm decides, and humans don‚Äôt get a say! Before moving an Entity into the Knowledge Vault, the Knowledge Vault Algorithm must first assess multiple resources from the web that corroborate the information in the Vertical Knowledge Graph to a level where it is absolutely sure the information is true.

A quick aside about the Web Vertical Knowledge Graph I talked about in the lesson about the Vertical Knowledge Graphs. Because it is not human curated like the others, it has a special role. In order to ‚Äúunderstand the whole world‚Äù, Google cannot rely on human curated sources - it needs to create knowledge from the open web. As Google expands the Knowledge Vault, the Web Vertical Knowledge Graph will increasingly serve as the best first-step for an Entity to be added to the Knowledge Vault. 

Some sources can partially skip this algorithmic validation process. Wikipedia is one example. However, as of late 2022, that is becoming less and less the case. 

At the end of the day, just remember - every entity and piece of information that is in the Main Knowledge Graph has been thoroughly checked and confirmed by the Algorithm beforehand. 

Your job is to ensure the information that allows it to understand the information about an entity and check the veracity is to present that information on multiple trusted authoritative sources in a format that the Knowledge Extraction Algorithm can confidently annotate‚Ä¶ starting with the Entity Home itself, of course :) 
Now I‚Äôll answer a question that should save you from some stressful waits and difficult conversations with clients. How Often Do Google‚Äôs Knowledge Algorithms Update?
Like the core algorithm, the three Knowledge Algorithms get manual updates by Google engineers - both algorithmic ‚Äútweaks‚Äù and injection of corrective and reinforcement training data. We cannot predict when these will happen, and when they do happen, Google doesn't tell us. Kalicube Pro tracks activity in all three Knowledge Algorithms and provides a sensor that alerts us and helps us understand what is happening when major changes occur across multiple entities.



All Google‚Äôs algorithms use Machine Learning to a large degree. That means that they are improving all the time - I like to say that they are in a constant state of learning to learn. That means any of them can suddenly have a ‚Äúlightbulb moment‚Äù about any piece of information about any entity at any moment. 


This is one reason why any individual Knowledge Panel, Knowledge Vault entry or confidence score in the Knowledge Vault can change from one day to the next without any updates to the algorithms or changes to the information online. 


Since the Knowledge Extraction Algorithm is attached to web crawling and the Web Index, it is categorising and tagging all the information as GoogleBot crawls the web. That means the Knowledge Extraction updates its assessment of ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù in real-time. Bear in mind that It updates each source individually and in isolation.


The algorithm that builds Knowledge Panels uses the web index, and is therefore in constant evolution on an Entity by Entity basis. However, it is very reticent about including new or updated information since this information is shown very prominently on the SERP, which means Google‚Äôs reputation for reliability is on the line. Here, it is helpful to consider that it requires multiple corroborative sources-at-a-time. It brings together multiple annotated sources when changing information in the ‚ÄúKnowledge Panel chest of drawers‚Äù.


The Knowledge Vault Algorithm is by far the slowest moving of the three. Google is still trying to get the foundation right. They need to be careful that the Knowledge Vault doesn‚Äôt fill up with junk as they move away from the human curated data provided by their foundational sources such as Wikipedia, Freebase, Wikidata, MusicBrainz and IMDB.


This means, updates are less frequent and, as of late 2022, appear to be dominated by manual intervention by Google engineers. That makes these updates more unpredictable than the other two. When the Knowledge Algorithm that feeds the Knowledge Vault is updated manually by engineers at Google the update is for one or more of the following three reasons: 
Algorithm tweaks,
An injection of curated training data,
A re-evaluation of the contents of the Knowledge Vault using data from the web index


That said, the Knowledge Vault Algorithm assesses the contents of the Knowledge Vault constantly. Any Entity can be added, removed or changed in the Knowledge Vault at any time. Tracking on Kalicube Pro suggests this affects well under 0.1% of entities daily.


All three major Knowledge Algorithms will affect your Knowledge Panel, short, medium and long term. 


The Knowledge Extraction Algorithm is constantly analysing pages by or about you on first, second and third party websites to create structured data from unstructured online content. You can usefully consider this to be a daily update.
 The Knowledge Panel Algorithm is constantly cross-checking facts extracted by the Knowledge Extraction Algorithms to ensure the contents of your Knowledge Panel are correct and up to date. You can usefully consider this to be a weekly update.
The Knowledge Vault Algorithm updates sporadically and in unpredictable ways since they are still closely and manually managed by Google engineers with a data lake approach. You can usefully consider this to be a monthly update.


You‚Äôll find an article about Data Lakes in the additional material for this lesson.


The final point of this lesson is that the trick for all three algorithms is to present information in a structured format, and ensure all first, second and third party web pages dedicated to the entity provide consistent corroboration.


To give you a timeline, here is what we see when we (or an agency) uses Kalicube Pro effectively. 
Getting a presence in the Web Index Vertical Knowledge Graph or the Knowledge Vault takes a few weeks to three months. Updating a piece of information in the Knowledge Panel will take a few days to a few weeks. 
Knowledge Panel management can feel like a slow process, and can be frustrating when nothing changes for weeks, or even months.


But now you understand how all three Knowledge Algorithms work and you have an idea of their timelines, you better understand WHY, and you understand what you need to do to ‚Äúconvince‚Äù each algorithm: structure, consistency and corroboration!"
Explanation of How Google Decides What Information to Show in a Knowledge Panel	"What information does Google show in a Knowledge Panel? Obviously that depends on the entity type, and we‚Äôll look at that in a moment.
But before delving into this topic, bear in mind what the Knowledge Panel is designed to do. The purpose of the Knowledge Panel is to show the user a factual summary of the entity to save Google's users time when researching an Entity. What they're trying to do is bring together the information from multiple sources to summarize the most important information and facts so the user gets an overview of the fundamental facts about the Entity without having to visit multiple sites. 
So what Google puts in the Knowledge Panel is what Google thinks the user would want to know at-a-glance.
Essentially it is a summary of essential and useful factual information from the left rail.
In order to be able to show information - a description or an attribute, a social channel, a song, a film - Google firstly needs to be very sure the information is true: it needs to understand and be confident in that understanding. But secondly it has to believe that the searcher will find the information helpful. 
That means Google doesn‚Äôt show all the information it has understood about the entity. So, try playing the Knowledge Panel hopping game, and you can see more of the information Google has and what it feels is of no interest to the casual searcher, but of interest to someone researching the entity.
NOTE - I have included a screencast of Knowledge Panel hopping me and V√©ro
So, here I click on Veronique Barnard, then click on my name in Veronique‚Äôs Knowledge Panel and that brings up a lot more information about me. Google understands that I am researching Jason Barnard because I clicked on a related Entity.
So don't be fooled by what you see on the initial search on the Entity name, dig down to see how many attributes, how much information Google has before you start worrying about working on trying to add them. If Google has the information and isn‚Äôt showing it, that is because it doesn‚Äôt believe that information is of primary importance. 
For a Knowledge Panel triggered by Google Podcasts, the Knowledge Panel will contain just the cover image and the description. You cannot add more information. The exception is if you can move the podcast over into the Knowledge Vault. This is what has happened for The Daily podcast - and their Knowledge Panel is full of useful information. We can consider this to be a ‚Äúproper, fully fledged entity‚Äù that can be managed and enhanced without the restrictions imposed by its original Knowledge vertical - in this case the Podcast Knowledge Graph. 
The situation is the same for Google Books and Google Scholar - to add additional information or change the description, you need to move the Entity into the Knowledge Vault.
You can check if your podcast or book, or any other entity is in the Knowledge Vault using the free Knowledge Graph explorer tool on Kalicube Pro. Look in the additional materials for the link.
https://kalicube.pro/knowledge-graph-explorer
Entities in the web index are not subject to specific restrictions; you can add additional information and get the description you want by following Kalicube‚Äôs 3 step process of Entity home, machine-understandable description and corroboration. Doing this will bring the additional benefit of moving the entity into the Knowledge Vault.
Google Business Profiles are a special case. Your business profile account gives you control of some items. Which elements you control depends on the type of business. For information that is not editable in the GBP management interface, you only have indirect control, much like for a Knowledge Panel. Examples of this are reviews from around the web, social channels, additional events and some descriptions. 
Note that, as of late 2022, for any business, the Google Business Profile will exist in addition to your Knowledge Panel and each will have its own kgmid. The Google Business Profile is the physical location of the business, and the Knowledge Panel is the business itself. Exceptions include educational establishments and tourist attractions where the Google Business Profile and the Knowledge Panel are merged and have one single kgmid. 
As I explained in other lessons, the best way to figure out what Google is likely to show in a Knowledge Panel is to look at what it is showing for Entity Equivalents - same entity type, same geo region, same industry. That will give you a good idea of what you can realistically aim for, and if you do a bit of Sherlock Holmes style investigation, you can generally figure out where Google is getting the information from. The trick there is obviously to then add your information to the same, or an equivalent source, and present the information in the same format - semantic triple, HTML list, HTML table or whatever.
In order to maximize your options for adding information to a Knowledge Panel, and also to exert the most influence on the contents, the aim is to get your entity into the Knowledge Vault since that has the least restrictions and caveats. Once there, you can manage the contents of the Knowledge Panel indirectly using the technique I keep repeating - add the information to the Entity home, creating second and third party corroboration and signposting.
Importantly, even when you're in the Knowledge Vault, the vast majority of information in the Knowledge Panel does not come directly from there. The one exception is entities that have been added to the Knowledge Graph by having a Wikipedia article where most of the information in the Panel will come from. For me that is yet another good reason to avoid Wikipedia. You really do hand over control to the faceless Wikipedia editors and admins.
For other entities that trigger a Knowledge Panel through the Knowledge Vault, the only information that comes directly from there is the name, and the kgmid. That‚Äôs it. Which sounds nuts. But it‚Äôs true. In the next lesson I‚Äôll explain how this actually works, and that the contents of Knowledge Panels are actually based on the web index. Exciting!
Thank you for watching. See you in the next lesson!"
Explanation of How You Can Change Information Google Displays in Knowledge Panels	"Huge question: How do you change information in a Knowledge Panel? There are multiple ways to do this but my number one rule here is to remember that the algorithms ultimately decide, as you‚Äôll see.
So, long term you need to work steadily and solidly towards being in a position to heavily influence the algorithms. I‚Äôd love to say ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù but, as with educating a child, all you can really do is help it, explain, re-explain, have things explained by relevant authoritative third parties, gradually build its trust in what you are communicating‚Ä¶ and by that long process you‚Äôll have a very strong influence. 
Once again, this ultimately means you first need to make sure that Google understands which page is the Entity Home and then learns to accept that that Entity Home is authoritative for the Entity.
That said you can ask humans at Google to change things in a Knowledge Panel. Knowledge Panels have a ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù button. Anyone can click on that and suggest changes. So even if you haven‚Äôt claimed the Knowledge Panel you can suggest changes. If you have claimed the Panel, then your suggestions are prioritized and have a higher likelihood of being accepted.
Either way, when doing this, you need to click on the pencil icon of the element you want to change (or delete, for that matter) and give a short explanation of the change you want, and provide links to at least two web pages that corroborate what you are saying. One of those pages can be a page you own, but the other needs to be at least partially independent. What you say on your own website is generally not enough. 
You can also give general feedback - for example if you want to add something.
With the explanation you provide, remember that the person at Google looking at your request has never seen this Knowledge Panel before and has no previous understanding of the Entity. So, a LITTLE context always helps. Make sure your request is brief, clear and to the point - the Google employees are under pressure to work fast, so they won‚Äôt spend a lot of time examining your request. Make it easy for them.
The time frame here varies. Anything from a day or two to a month. Once the person at Google has made a decision, you‚Äôll receive an email telling you whether they have applied your suggestion or not. I haven‚Äôt seen a case where the request is not dealt with, so don‚Äôt keep submitting the same request over and over. Doing that will probably keep pushing you to the back of the queue, rather than bumping you up to the front :)
Bear in mind that, even though the option to make a suggestion is available in the Knowledge Panel, there are some restrictions. For example, Google employees cannot edit the subtitle. They can remove the subtitle and a new one will be chosen by the algorithm. The title can only be changed if there is a major issue with it and you have significant supporting evidence. In 10 years, I have never seen this happen.
Humans at Google do not choose the description. That is algorithmic. The best way to get the description you want is, once again the Kalicube 3 step process, and using the same description everywhere on the web. Eventually, you will probably get the description coming from your website, like we have at Kalicube. 

Social profiles can be added or removed, but not reordered.
Some items simply cannot be changed by Google employees - attributes often cannot be changed, and any information that contravenes Google policies will not be changed.
You can suggest changes for People Also Search For and images however, Google employees can only remove them and will only do so when the information contravenes their policies. Also note that even here, the algorithm can revert the change.
Look in the additional materials and you‚Äôll find a link to Google‚Äôs official help document about manual changes to a Knowledge Panel
https://support.google.com/knowledgepanel/answer/7534842?hl=en
A really good use of your time is to read the help documents at https://support.google.com - Google is surprisingly open about what the processes are and what rules you need to follow.
I do encourage you to use the "suggest and edit" option on the Knowledge Panel and ask for additions and changes where you feel the information is important. However, ultimately the algorithm will decide, as we will see.
Here‚Äôs a story to illustrate. A client came to me to help correct her Knowledge Panel - she is an author and the wrong book was appearing. The book was written by her namesake - another author with exactly the same name. Google‚Äôs algorithms had got it wrong, and were showing the other author‚Äôs book in my clients‚Äô Knowledge Panel.
She had claimed her Knowledge Panel and suggested the change using the ‚Äúsuggest an edit‚Äù option. The Google employee implemented the change as she requested and removed the book. So why did she come to me ? Because the algorithms switched the change back within a week. That book written by her namesake was back. 
The algorithms ultimately control. If they think the human got it wrong, they will revert to their ‚Äútruth‚Äù. 
What is the solution? You need to investigate - play Sherlock Holmes - and figure out WHY the machine is misunderstanding, and then remove or correct the information that is causing confusion.
In this case, we found that both authors were published by the same company and the publisher website had an author profile page that had the books mixed up. When the publisher corrected their mistake, the Knowledge Panel corrected itself within a month. 
Now, the reason algorithms have more ultimate control is because Google is using Machine Learning to grow the Knowledge Graph and to populate Knowledge Panels. It cannot build an understanding of the entire world using only human curated sources. 
What Google engineers are doing is to teach the machine to learn how to learn. The machine is being taught to get better and better at figuring out what is fact, what is not fact, what it can show, what it can't show, which named entity is which, what their attributes are, what the relationships are‚Ä¶ Massive!
Google engineers simply feed corrective and reinforcement data into the algorithm and tweak the algorithm from time to time. The machine effectively runs itself and makes its own decisions.
What do I mean by feeding corrective and reinforcement data? Corrective data is information that the machine got wrong. Providing examples of where it made a mistake helps the machine evolve - helps it learn to learn, as it were. The feedback button is one example. Every time a human being at Google changes something in the Knowledge Panel through the feedback they are giving the machine one example of where it made a mistake. But this is one tiny signal to the algorithms, and as we have seen, it can choose to ignore that specific correction. 
Reinforcement data consists of examples of information that the algorithms got right. As with a child, in order to learn it needs to know both when it got things right as well as when it got things wrong. 
The feedback button is a miniscule proportion of the corrective and reinforcement data Google is feeding into the machine. We don‚Äôt know how much but you can be sure that the machine regularly receives millions of pieces of corrective and reinforcement information as well as vast amounts of additional human curated information.
So, back to the practicalities for you and the Knowledge Panel you want to change. Suggesting an edit is great, and it works very well as long as you provide solid supporting evidence. Ultimately, though your capacity to change information in your Knowledge Panel is driven by your capacity to educate Google about the Entity, the attributes of that Entity and the relationships between that Entity and other entities (as always, the closer, stronger, and longer relationships are the ones that you can leverage most powerfully). 
And THAT means having a strong, authoritative Entity Home, solid corroborative sources and a solid set of signposts in place.
Another example of changing information in a Knowledge Panel I‚Äôd like to share with you is the case of a company for whom the Knowledge Panel showed an inaccurate figure for yearly revenues. The client had not communicated that on their site, so Google took a figure from an article about them written by a third party who had gotten the information wrong. 
We had the Entity Home under control, so we knew we had a good chance of correcting this algorithmically. We wrote a short article about the business figures of the company, included the revenues and some other financial details in a HTML table, added some internal links with an anchor text ‚Äúfinancials 2021‚Äù from the Entity Home and two other relevant pages. We submitted all those pages through Search Console and in two weeks, the information in the Knowledge Panel was correct. 
To get a description if there isn‚Äôt one, or to get the description you want if Google is using one you don‚Äôt like, the solution is to take the description you wrote in step 2 of the Kalicube process and duplicate that everywhere around the web. 
A quick note on exceptions. As of late 2022 it is not possible to replace the information and description when the Knowledge Panel is using Wikipedia, Google Books, Google Scholar or Google Podcasts as the source. That will certainly change in the future as Google detaches the Knowledge Graph from that initial core of human curated data.
If you want to add attributes the trick is to provide that information in an HTML table or using a simple semantic triple near the start of your Entity Description, and then duplicating that around the web. You can also add the information to structured information on trusted sources such as Crunchbase, Wikidata, Wikipedia, IMDB, MusicBrainz, Linked in etc.
We maintain a list at Kalicube and share some of that data publicly on kalicube.pro
The best way to find WHICH attributes you are likely able to add to a Knowledge Panel is to look at what appears for Entity Equivalents - that is what appears for entities of the same type, the same geo region and the same industry. If an attribute appears from them, you can expect to be able to get it for your entity. 
Always remember that Google wants to show useful information about the entity to its users, so a person‚Äôs shoe size is an attribute that only makes sense if they have particularly small or big feet, for example. I know someone who managed to get his shoe size in his Knowledge Panel. His shoe size is 9. The algorithms removed that attribute pretty quickly after it appeared :)
Description sources, attributes, People Also Search For, social channels - in short anything that appears in a Knowledge Panel - is what we track at scale on the Kalicube Pro SaaS platform so that we know where to place information so it is picked up by Google and also what information Google tends to show for specific entity-geo-industry combinations‚Ä¶. Entity Equivalents is a hugely powerful concept - spying on the competition always makes sense :)
Just to reiterate one last time - the algorithms ultimately decide what is displayed in a Knowledge Panel, so if you want any level of control long term then you need to focus on the Entity Home, a clear presentation of the information that matters to you and authoritative corroboration."
Explanation of How to Claim a Knowledge Panel and When You Should Claim Your Knowledge Panel	"Why should you claim your Knowledge Panel? Firstly because it prevents anyone else from claiming it. Secondly it allows you to ask humans at Google to make changes and add information. Rather than the usual ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù option, you have a ‚Äúsuggest edits‚Äù option. The possibilities are the same, however your suggested edits go to the front of the (long) queue, gives you priority and you have more authority in their eyes and your edits are much more likely to be accepted.

How to claim a Knowledge Panel depends on several factors. But also, whether or not the Knowledge Panel is claimable depends on the vertical. 

You can only claim the Knowledge Panel if you are the entity (person), you own the entity (companies, books) or officially represent the entity (films, a person‚Äôs agent etc)

If you see the ‚ÄúClaim this Knowledge Panel‚Äù, then it is claimable. Sounds obvious, I know :) If there is no ‚ÄúClaim this Knowledge Panel‚Äù option, then either it has already been claimed or it is not claimable by anyone.

Here are some reasons a Knowledge Panel may not be claimable:

It was triggered by Google Books, Google Podcasts or another closed Google-owned property.

It is a ‚Äúsprout‚Äù - ie it has very little information in it, perhaps just a photo and a name

It is part of the web index vertical - those are not claimable

There are several processes for claiming a claimable Knowledge Panel. The first is the manual system. Google has a very long form where you need to provide a photo of your passport, a photo of yourself holding your passport, and screenshots of you logged into the entity‚Äôs official social media accounts. If you are claiming a Knowledge Panel where you represent it as an agent or employee, then you‚Äôll need to also prove you are an official representative. All of that makes the process long, and difficult and, because on Google‚Äôs side this is a human process, it can be unpredictable.

Another process is through Search Console. If Google‚Äôs algorithms have established which site represents the entity, then if you manage that property in Google Search Console, you can claim the Knowledge Panel automatically, immediately and with no human interaction with Google‚Ä¶ And no form to fill in !

If Google‚Äôs algorithms have established which Twitter, Facebook or YouTube account represents the entity, then you can claim the Knowledge Panel by logging into that account automatically, immediately and, once again, with no human interaction with Google‚Ä¶

Sometimes you‚Äôll see a Knowledge Panel that is claimable but that I would suggest you do not claim unless you can do so automatically through Search Console or a social account. 

If a Knowledge Panel has obviously been triggered purely by unreliable or paid-for sources such as WikiEverybody, Wikitia and some others, then the human who checks your request will probably simply delete it. This is because they want to give corrective information to the machine so that it learns to understand which types of sources it should not trust.

I would also advise against claiming a Knowledge Panel if there is very little information in it. Google‚Äôs aim is to bring value to the user and a small Knowledge Panel with just a name, a subtitle and a photo doesn‚Äôt bring any information that the searcher doesn‚Äôt already know. The purpose of a Knowledge Panel is to provide a summary of the entity to allow Google‚Äôs user to understand more about the entity without clicking on multiple results. With that perspective, a small Knowledge Panel with no information that is not already in the Left Rail makes no sense, so a human at Google will probably delete it.

In both these cases, it is best to make it richer and ensure multiple sources are contributing, and / or get the Entity Home or Social media profile recognised by the algorithm so you can claim it directly. How? Ironically, Kalicube‚Äôs 3 step process is the best, safest and most reliable way to get Google to recognise the Entity Home, Social Profiles and include additional information in the Knowledge Panel :)

As you can now see, the Entity Home is key at every single step of managing the Knowledge Panel. At Kalicube we always focus on the Entity Home for our clients since it allows us to claim the Panel, to push accurate information into the Knowledge Graph and to build its confidence over time. In short, the Entity Home is as close to control as you will get. 

Now, if you see this world icon with your domain name, that is the Entity Home Google has chosen. That means you can definitely claim through Google Search Console. But if you don‚Äôt see the world icon and your domain name in the Knowledge Panel, click on ‚ÄúClaim this Knowledge Panel‚Äù anyway and see since Google may have recognised the domain and has chosen not to show it, or Google may provide the option of claiming through Twitter, Facebook or YouTube.

Last point. What can you do if someone else has claimed your Knowledge Panel? You‚Äôll need to contact Google directly. Look in the additional materials for this lesson and you‚Äôll find a link to that form and also detailed information about managing your Knowledge Panel once you have claimed it."
Explanation of Google's Six Knowledge Graph Verticals	"You might think that all Knowledge Panels are directly linked to Google's main Knowledge Graph, which we can also call the Knowledge Vault. This isn't the case. Knowledge Panels are triggered by multiple vertical knowledge graphs in Google's ecosystem.
Outside the main Knowledge Graph, The most obvious example is Google Business Profiles. Now they are a slight cheat since they are essentially business listings. However, they are part of Google‚Äôs biggest Knowledge Graph - Google Maps. Google Maps is a huge knowledge graph that can provide solutions to geo-spatial entity-to-entity queries it has never seen before in real time.
As a quick aside - think about how you use Google Maps. That will give you a good idea how the Knowledge Graph will be integrated into Search and other Google products in the coming years. Also, Google Maps is massive. In comparison, the main Knowledge Graph with ‚Äújust‚Äù 150 billion facts is tiny. But eventually, the main Knowledge Graph will become bigger than Google Maps ‚Ä¶ and I would guess Google will merge the two. When that happens, Entity Management will become the single most important aspect of SEO, digital brand management, online reputation management and digital marketing generally. At Kalicube, we are very much looking forward to that day, of course.
Back to Google Business Profile. Although the business provides some of the information, much of the contents are added by Google‚Äôs algorithms. For example, the social profiles, reviews from around the web, some descriptions, additional facts, the popular times ‚Ä¶. And much more.
Examples of Google‚Äôs multiple vertical Knowledge Graphs that trigger Knowledge Panels on Google SERPs are: 
Google Podcasts, Google Scholar, Google Books, Google Shopping, YouTube Music, and there is even a Web Index Knowledge Graph. The Knowledge Vault is the ultimate place to be. That is where Google is moving ALL entities, whichever vertical they belong to initially.
HUGELY important is that the contents of the Knowledge Vault cannot be changed directly by any human. That is an important point. Google‚Äôs Knowledge Vault is 100% controlled by the algorithms. No human inside or outside Google can directly change information in the Knowledge Vault. So, once you are in there, every action you take, every change you want to make will be indirect. 
In most of the other verticals such as Google Books, Google Business, you have some direct control. In the web index Knowledge Graph you have indirect, but relatively short term influence.
However, ultimately, you are going to end up in the Knowledge Vault, aka the Main Knowledge Graph. Three points here. Firstly, any vertical outside the Knowledge Vault allows you some control. Secondly, don‚Äôt rush to get in there. Prepare the groundwork. Use the control whilst you have it. Create a strategy that ensures the basic understanding Google has is correct BEFOREit adds you to the Knowledge Vault. Thirdly, when Google adds your entity to the Knowledge Vault - which it will eventually do whether you want it to or not - your control will be indirect and difficult and any changes you try to implement will be slow. 
Given that it is the basis of everything to come in all Google products - aka the Google-verse - accuracy in the foundational information about your entity in the Knowledge Vault today is absolutely essential. 
You can easily get a Knowledge Panel without the Knowledge Vault. So the Knowledge Vault generally isn‚Äôt the place to start. It is, of course, where you will end up. But the best short and mid term Knowledge Panel strategy depends very heavily on the Entity type and the presence - or not - of the entity in one or more of these verticals. 
The Knowledge Vault is hugely important and very interesting. But the Knowledge Panel is what your audience sees. So, the Knowledge Vault is a vanity metric. The Knowledge Panel is the pragmatic representation of your entity to your audience on Google, be it company, person, film, music group, podcast or whatever.
Wikipedia-worthy entities aside, the Knowledge Vault is not likely to be your best strategy. Google‚Äôs verticals are most likely to be your short and mid term targets. 
Intriguingly, Google's advantage of having a lot of different human curated data sets such as Google Books and Google Podcasts is both an advantage and a disadvantage for Google. 
An advantage because they have human curated data. A disadvantage because they can‚Äôt easily connect these vertical knowledge graphs horizontally. Because they are all built differently, are managed by different teams and are at different levels of maturity, connecting them horizontally in real time in Google Search and other Google products is a huge challenge.
Currently, to join these vertical Knowledge Graphs together, the different algorithms and services (search, NLP, image and so on) use a shared lookup table that provides the kgmid and entity name. All the algorithms refer to this lookup table. But they have only share the most basic information‚Ä¶ which explains some of the seemingly ‚Äústupid‚Äù results of mismatching photos, names, attributes etc.
On the other hand, Microsoft has fewer owned knowledge bases and they have built their knowledge graph and provide Knowledge Panels directly from their web index. As you can imagine, this makes everything much simpler for them, and that means they do it very, very well - arguably better than Google :) Getting a Knowledge Panel on Bing is relatively easy from the perspective that the work you will do to get a Knowledge Panel on Google will almost guarantee a very good Knowledge Panel and Entity presentation on Bing. I do suggest keeping an eye on Bing since it will give you insights into where the data is taken from. It is a fair bet that Google is using much the same sources as Bing, and Bing are more open about the sources they are citing:
Now, Microsoft is building a Knowledge Graph primarily using their web index. Although Google has all these vertical knowledge graphs it is, of course, doing the same thing. As we‚Äôll see, for podcasts, books, authors, scholars and musicians the easy way to get a Knowledge Panel is focussing on the relevant vertical.
For people and companies who have no presence in those verticals, the web index Knowledge Graph is the best entry. An increasing number of Knowledge Panels are triggered by this web vertical index. For the most part they are small ‚Äúsprouts‚Äù with little information. But, if you think about the ‚Äútree and twigs‚Äù analogy from the lesson about how Google is building its Knowledge Vault, the web index Knowledge Graph is the ultimate sprout of a twig that you can then attach to a branch in the Knowledge Vault.
A quick reminder I currently refer to what Google calls ‚Äúthe Knowledge Graph‚Äù as either the ‚ÄúMain Knowledge Graph‚Äù or the ‚ÄúKnowledge Vault‚Äù. Whatever we call it, the important point is that this is a source of fact and information that no human can directly change. 

So, back to an explanation of how Google reconciles these multiple verticals. It uses a unique identifier - kgmid - for each entity and uses a lookup table to try to join these different Knowledge Graphs as best it can. 
So, each vertical attributes a kgmid to entities within its sphere. Within Google Books, Google Podcasts and other isolated services, this isn‚Äôt an issue. As users within a specific vertical such as Google Books, Google can show us the ‚Äúwho, what and where‚Äù reliably. 
But these vertical Knowledge Graphs cannot directly compare their named entity to the same named entity in other verticals. And all Google services - especially Google Search and Google Discover - need a unified approach and horizontal communication. Otherwise, as users we see some strange results such as the wrong photo for a person, or the wrong book attributed to an author. 
This is HUGE. And ultimately the only solution is including all entities in the Knowledge Vault. But that is literally a decade or more away.
So, short and mid term, what is your best bet for a Knowledge Panel that you can manage effectively?
Always focus on the kgmid. Always be aware that something you think is a single entity might be two (or more).
For example, your kgmid and Knowledge Panel for your Google Business Profile is your outlet or head office‚Ä¶ both of which are entities in their own right. 
Your company is another entity that will need its own kgmid. As the founder, you are another entity and you need your own kgmid. Each product you manufacture or service you offer will need its own kgmid, even if you are a uni-service or uniproduct company and your product or service has the same name as the company.
Think about that. Kalicube is a company - entity and kgmid #1. Kalicube has an office in the South of France on Google Maps - entity and kgmid #2. We have a software called Kalicube - entity and kgmid #3. We also have an event series called ‚ÄúKalicube Tuesdays‚Äù - entity and kgmid #4.
Boowa and Kwala is a TV series - entity and kgmid #1. Boowa & Kwala using the ampersand is potentially another TV series but we need to ensure Google doesn‚Äôt see it as entity and kgmid #2 since the word "and" and the ampersand symbol are the same thing. Surprisingly, Google often gets this wrong because it is VERY literal. Boowa and Kwala is also a song - that is entity and kgmid #2. Lastly, Boowa and Kwala is a fictional universe that is entity and kgmid #3.
Be VERY aware of that. If you aren‚Äôt clear in your mind, and consistent in your presentation, then Google will never understand. 
If you have a podcast that is on Google Podcasts, it will automatically generate a kgmid and most likely trigger a Knowledge Panel.
If you have published a book and it is in Google books, you as an author will have a kgmid attributed by Google Books. Each of your books will also have a kgmid. You and your books will therefore have a Knowledge Panel in Google‚Äôs ‚Äúbrain‚Äù. Whether that triggers a search or not depends on many factors that I will cover in another lesson. 
If you have released a song or a music album, and it is on YouTube Music, Spotify or MusicBrainz, then each of your songs, your music album and yourself will also have a kgmid. You, each of your songs and your albums will therefore have a Knowledge Panel in Google‚Äôs ‚Äúbrain‚Äù. As with books, whether that triggers a search or not depends on many factors.
Google Merchant, for products, is still in its early stages but its structure appears to function much in the same way as songs, music albums and artists. That is, we have a manufacturer, a series of products, a specific iteration within that series of products, multiple sellers of that product with different offers at different times... you get the idea. The Google Merchant Feed is vital here. Get that right, and you are halfway there. However, Google is now using the Schema you include on your product pages to cross check. It seems Schema will take the upper hand, so focus on that and make sure the Merchant Feed and Schema are always in synch. Our friends at Wordlift have an incredibly powerful solution for this for ecommerce sites‚Ä¶. With an added bonus that they can automatically generate great product descriptions at scale. 
Google Scholar will trigger a Knowledge Panel for academics. 
I haven‚Äôt mentioned Google Images. That, too, has a Knowledge Graph and attributes kgmid. Google images is intriguing because it triggers kgmid, but rarely triggers a Knowledge Panel on its own. It is a great springboard for entities that don‚Äôt fit into podcasts, film, music, shopping, scholars and so on. So consistency with images is a huge step forwards.
Lastly, and most importantly, is the web index. This is huge. Better than Google Images, this allows Entities that don‚Äôt fit into the obvious Google-owned verticals to get a foothold. If you can get your entity into this vertical, then all you need to do is follow the three step process we advocate at Kalicube - please do watch the previous lessons if you haven‚Äôt already done so - and your entity will trigger a Knowledge Panel on a Brand Search and also move into the Knowledge Vault. All you need to do is create consistency and build confidence.
Depending on the vertical, you have more or less direct control. Google podcasts offers a lot of control since the information comes from your own feed. Google Business Profiles offer some control - let‚Äôs say two thirds. Google Books offers immense control when you initially publish the book. But that is a one-shot. Changing it afterwards is a huge challenge. 
Outside famous people, major corporations, podcasts, books, scholars and musicians - who each have their own Google vertical - the Google web index vertical is where you want to start. I would even argue this is ideal since, when you make a real effort, you can control this information simply by being consistent and focussing on the right sources around the web.
And once in the web index Knowledge Graph, moving into the Knowledge Vault is simply a question of ensuring that the information about your entity is super consistent over time. And building confidence is purely about that consistency and what I would refer to as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù online exposure by third party sources.
Short term, you can leverage the different verticals to get a Knowledge Panel. Long term, Google will move your entity into the Knowledge Vault where you have no direct control. At that point, if you want any level of control, you need to ensure Google recognises your chosen Entity Home.
That will allow you to leverage, influence and potentially have control over Google's understanding of your Entity in the Knowledge Vault and how it presents you to your audience in its Knowledge Panels.
We do this all day long at Kalicube. It is simple, and yet complex since every entity type has its own vertical, each entity is unique and how Google then pulls together the multiple sources of information it has to build a Knowledge Panel is a HUGELY intricate process, that I will explain in the upcoming lessons."
Explanation of How Google's Knowledge Graph Works	"In this lesson I‚Äôll explain how a Knowledge Graph works. Understanding this is hugely helpful when adding information to a Knowledge Graph from the outside, which is what we are doing here with Google. 
A Knowledge Graph is built up of nodes, attributes, edges and paths. We're going to start with nodes, attributes and edges. Paths are super important one you have the initial node setup with attributes and some edges.
I know this might sound like gobbledygook ‚Ä¶ But behind the words, the concepts are actually very simple.
Nodes are entities (a person, a road, a company and so on), attributes are properties (height, colour, age, and so on) and edges are relationships between two entities (works for, parent of, founder and so on). 
Importantly, this is how the human brain functions, which makes the entire concept of Knowledge graphs very easy to understand. As humans, we understand the world through entities and their relationships between them. ‚ÄúJason Barnard works for Kalicube‚Äù. And, as you might have noticed, simple grammar also functions this way. Entity-relationship-entity is a simple subject-verb-object ‚ÄúJason Barnard voiced Boowa‚Äù - Boowa is the cartoon blue dog I played in a TV series, by the way. And attributes are often adjectives ‚Äúthe red bus drives in London‚Äù. Here red is an attribute, bus is an entity, drives is a relationship with the entity London. Everything in 3s.
When teaching children, 3 is often referred to as a magic number. It is magic. Our brains work in threes. And so do Knowledge Graphs :)
Here is a simple Knowledge Graph Google uses to illustrate theirs.


In terms of how Google is growing its Knowledge Graph, we can use an analogy of a tree. Google built the trunk of the tree using human curated sources - Freebase, IMDB, MusicBrainz, Wikidata and Wikipedia. The Knowledge Graph is built with this solid, reliable information at its core. Google then started adding some thick, solid branches using its own knowledge bases such as Google podcasts, Google Books, Google Scholars. It‚Äôs a little more complex than that, but I‚Äôll go into more detail into Google‚Äôs own knowledge sources in the lesson about the different Knowledge Graph verticals that trigger Knowledge Panels. They also included some information from DNB, Crunchbase and several other third party sources. Quite what their criteria or methods were is unclear.
But the crux here is that so far, this is all human curated - i.e. entities, attributes and relationships that have been checked by humans. Obviously not 100% accurate. But sufficiently reliable for Google to use this to show its Knowledge algorithms what ‚Äúfact looks like‚Äù so that they can then train the algorithms to learn to figure out the facts on their own.
At Kalicube we have data going back to 2017. That data suggests that initially, if the information wasn‚Äôt corroborated by one of the core sources mentioned above, it wouldn‚Äôt be added to the Knowledge Graph. 
So, the next step was to add some additional branches. From around 2020, Google has given the algorithms the freedom to establish facts and add to the Knowledge Graph using information from Google's web index. Initially this seems to have been limited to a seed set of relatively reliable sources - both the generally recognised ones such as Amazon, LinkedIn, Crunchbase, Rotten Tomatoes, Spotify and so on, but also some hyper niche sites that had established themselves as authorities in that niche. At Kalicube we had significant successes independently of the obvious sources, including using my own website jasonbarnard.com.
Today, Google is allowing the Knowledge algorithms to add ‚Äútwigs‚Äù to the solid branches using data from the web index to establish facts without human intervention. It is learning on its own. This is HUGE.
This visual shows how much information comes from. As at September 2022, 71% is the human curated trunk, 15% is Google‚Äôs human curated solid branches, 12% is machine-defined facts from a seed set and 2% is twigs from the open web.
2% seems very small. But that is 2% of 150 BILLION facts. And once again, at Kalicube we have had considerable success in adding information to this 2% for ourselves and our clients using the strategies I teach in this course.
2% ‚ÄúTwigs from the open web‚Äù sounds a little disappointing and not very motivating, but think about what will happen. You add a twig today and that twig will grow - think: confidence - and become a branch, and then Google will attach new twigs to that, then new twigs to those and so on and so on. The sooner you add your twig to this Knowledge Graph ‚Äútree‚Äù, the closer you are to the main branches, the more important your branch becomes to the structure of the tree, the SAFER your place in the Knowledge Graph is and the more stable, reliable and solid your Knowledge Panel will be. 
Now, in a Knowledge Graph, you cannot add a new entity unless it is connected to an existing entity. So one of the tricks to adding entities to Google's Knowledge Graph is to add your Entity by indicating a relationship to one or more Entities that are already in the Knowledge Graph. 
You are looking for relationships that are close, strong and long. The best entities to use are those that have the closest, strongest and most permanent relationship. Ideally, you‚Äôll find an entity that is as close to the trunk as possible. But don‚Äôt try to connect your entity to a ‚Äúcore entity‚Äù unless there is a real, meaningful relationship that is one or more of close, strong and long-lasting. 
For example, I wouldn‚Äôt emphasise my relationship with Sting. We both play bass. That is a permanent relationship, but is very distant and incredibly weak. I would emphasise my relationship with Boowa and Kwala. Since my wife and I created them and voiced the characters in the TV series, that is a VERY close, strong and permanent relationship. Or my mother. She is a famous Jazz musician. She is close to the trunk of our ‚ÄúKnowledge tree‚Äù, and that is a very close, strong, and permanent relationship.

More pragmatically for a company:
A close relationship for a company would be an employee versus a subcontractor. A sub organisation would be a stronger relationship than a commercial partner. The company founder would be a longer relationship than the CEO. 
Now, the next question is what factors allow Google to reliably identify a named entity? It recognizes a named entity by a combination of its name - i.e. the string of characters - the relationships it sees to other named entities and the attributes of the Entity.
So it recognizes Jason Barnard firstly by the string of characters, J A S O N B A R N A R D. But there are more than 300 Jason Barnard‚Äôs in the world and at least 4 in the Knowledge Graph. It recognizes that I am this specific Jason Barnard through my attributes - my date of birth, my height and thirdly it looks at my relationships to other entities - with my mother, my sister, my Alma Mater Liverpool John Moore's university.
Now, how does it become sufficiently confident in that understanding of the named entity to add it to the Knowledge Graph? It looks at first, second and relevant third party sources and looks for corroboration.
In short, we are looking to draw Google‚Äôs attention to permanent attributes such as date of birth, founding date, founder, launch date‚Ä¶ and also indicate solid and meaningful relationships to entities that are in the Knowledge Graph.
Importantly, don‚Äôt obsess about the trunk. Wikipedia and Wikidata are important. But they are not necessary. The tree is now solid enough that Google can add twigs and branches that do not connect to the trunk.
The last part of this lesson is paths. You can look at these as indirect relationships. If you have heard of the game ‚ÄúSix degrees of Kevin Bacon‚Äù, you‚Äôll get the idea right away with no further explanation.
The game, centred around the "six degrees of separation" theory that any two people are only ever six or less connections apart, involves linking anyone in Hollywood to prolific actor Kevin Bacon via their roles in six film titles or less.
In the case of a Knowledge graph it simply means that everything is ultimately connected to everything else in six steps or less. Using the Knowledge Graph, Google is mapping the path from one Entity to another through tertiary entities and showing them on the SERPs in the form of Carousels and other Rich Elements. 
For example, it understands Jason Barnard. It understands that I am an alumni of Liverpool John Moores University. It understands that John Lennon also attended that university. That means I am just one hop away from John Lennon and get a place next to him in a carousel in a Google SERP. 
We will see Google displaying items using this type of indirect path relationship in the coming years. This is going to be an amazing opportunity to get more visibility on Google properties - not only Google search but also Discover, Images, Books, Podcasts, YouTube and any other services Google releases.
I play a game I call Knowledge Panel Hopping. It is a little like the six degrees of Kevin Bacon. But I am playing the game to understand the paths Google has in the Knowledge Graph and to inspire ideas about what information - attributes and relationships - I can best leverage when educating Google about an Entity.
NOTE - show a screencast of Knowledge Panel hopping for a company

Once you have the basics in place, Knowledge Panel Hopping will enable you to better understand where you need to go next.
Also, as you can see here, a quick hop back and forth uncovers information Google has in the Knowledge graph that it didn‚Äôt initially show. NOTE - I have recorded this video for you 
And Knowledge Panel hopping is something we can expect to become natural and normal behaviour by Google's users as it adds more Knowledge Panels and more factual information in and around those panels. 
Researching a film or film star purely on Google's SERPs is something people already do. In a few years, thoroughly researching a person, a product or a company using just the "factual" information provided by Google is likely to become commonplace. 
At that point our audience using Google will be looking at us through Google's eyes and Knowledge Panel hopping will not be a game any more and path analysis will be a HUGE part of Knowledge Panel management."
Explanation of How to Use Schema Markup to get a Knowledge Panel on Google	"This lesson is all about joining the dots, using Schema.org Markup.
This is the geeky way to join the dots. It is very powerful, so 

if you can do it this way, you will definitely have an advantage over using just a great description and links in the page. 
It also allows you to add additional information and corroboration that you can‚Äôt practically do otherwise. So even if you aren‚Äôt a geek, stick with it. 
And remember that we have an easy-to-use free tool on Kalicube Pro that will do the geeky part for you.
So, once you have identified your Entity Home, added a clear description, and you've made sure that multiple first, second, and third party sources corroborate
‚Ä¶ you need to indicate to the child the places it should be looking.
The non geeky method is using hyperlinks on the Entity Home. 
Schema Markup is the geeky, and more powerful way of joining the dots for Google and bringing all this together. 
You can think about Schema.org as Google‚Äôs native language. 
You use it to re-explain to Google everything you‚Äôve applied in the previous lessons to Google in a language it can digest natively. 
This explicit repetition is supportive of what you‚Äôve explained with the entity home, description and corroboration - it‚Äôs a support Google GREATLY appreciates and is a HUGE help building its confidence in its understanding.
Firstly, a quick word about what you are building. 
You need to choose the correct Schema.org type - Person, Corporation, PodcastSeries, Book etc
You are then building your Schema Markup to describe this entity to Google in what I call its native language. 
You can use the Entity Type as the root of your Schema like this.

At Kalicube Pro we integrate the Entity Schema into the Schema type AboutPage. We find this to be highly effective and allows us more flexibility and scope in what we can communicate to Google. 

Your Schema Markup should be showing information that you already have in the page with some exceptions. 
Those exceptions are 
links in the form of sameAs and subjectOf that don't help the user experience. An example here would be the Wikidata page, Crunchbase or Zoominfo profile. 
Examples of other additional information that you would include in the Schema Markup, but probably won‚Äôt include in the Entity Home would be the date and place of birth of the Person, their parents or siblings, or for a Company, perhaps the founding date or an exhaustive list of the C-Level employees.
This additional information should be relevant and help Google in one of three aims: 
to disambiguate between entities with the same name (date and place of birth is great for identifying a specific ‚ÄúJason Barnard‚Äù, for example), 
to provide information that can be used as attributes for the Knowledge Panel (awards and qualifications, for example), or 
to indicate relationships that Google can use to better link you to other entities in its Knowledge Graph (subsidiaries, siblings, parents, for example).
A quick word about the difference between the sameAs and url properties in Schema. 
Historically, there was an important distinction between them, however, as with many things, because people use them in very different manners, that distinction has become very blurred. 
At Kalicube we follow one simple rule. The url property is for the Entity Home and the sameAs is for all corroborative sources. 
Additionally, only add corroborative sources to sameAs or subjectOf if that page is 80% or more about the Entity. 
Google has trouble distinguishing reliably between multiple entities on the same page, so you really need to only use pages that are truly only about that specific Entity, or you are throwing a curveball to Google.
SameAs is for profile pages. Examples for sameAs would be: 
the Twitter profile for the entity, 
Facebook profile, 
LinkedIn profile, 
Crunchbase profile, 
MuckRack if the entity is a writer.
SubjectOf is for second and third party articles and videos that are dedicated to the entity. 
Examples for subjectOf for a company would be: 
an article about the company in inc.com, 
a video report about the company on YouTube or on a TV channel website. 
Examples for a person would be 
an interview on entreprener.com, 
a biographical piece by a blogger or journalist, or 
an interview with the person on a YouTube video. 
Importantly, do NOT add sameAs or subjectOf to unclear or contradictory information about the Entity. 
This will confuse Google and reduce its confidence and make the Knowledge Panel harder to get, rather than easier. 
More is better is not the approach. More consistent corroboration on relevant sources is the correct approach.
A few incredibly authoritative, relevant and accurate sameAs will be FAR more effective than dozens of unclear or descriptions on irrelevant or non-authoritative sources. 
If you have a doubt about the relevancy, authoritativeness, trustworthiness or accuracy of a page don't include it.
Always bear in mind that first party sources have the least influence (other than the Entity Home), 
second party sources have more influence, 
but third party sources are the ones you really need. 
Also, first party sites will have a very fast rate of diminishing returns in terms of building confidence, 
second party websites will have a slower rate of diminishing returns and 
third party sites will tend to have a low rate of diminishing returns - so you want to build those third party references over time. 
One very powerful trick that I will go into in more detail in a future lesson is to find relevant and authoritative media sites willing to publish an interview with you. 
Many journalists will simply send you a list of questions and you write the answers. If you write them well, and the answers are helpful, clear, relatively neutral (i.e. not too self-congratulatory) and not sales-y, then the journalist will generally change very little, then publish it under their own name. 
And that is delightful because even though you are the person who actually wrote the texts, the third party is putting their name and their reputation behind those words and it becomes third party corroboration. 
One small important point is that it is generally better not to overload it until Google has understood the basics and is at least a little bit confident. 
The more information you throw at it too soon, the more likely you are to confuse it. The web evolves constantly, so you will always be able to get more ambitious and add more a few months in the future.
Also remember that just because a property exists in Schema.org it doesn‚Äôt mean Google‚Äôs Knowledge algorithms can necessarily use that property in any meaningful way today. 
Beyond the obvious, we don‚Äôt know for sure which properties Google‚Äôs Knowledge algorithms actually understand and can use in the context of Knowledge Panels.
The basics that you need to start with for a company include: 
company name, 
alternate names, 
legal name, 
parent organization, 
sub organizations, 
founding date, 
founding place, 
founders, 
contact points, 
tax id, 
logo. 
You would then build up with other information such as 
awards, 
C-level employees, 
images and so on.
The basics that you need to start with for a person include: 
first name, 
family name, 
middle name, 
birth date, 
birth place, 
gender, 
nationality, 
alumni of (ie university), 
job title, 
employer, 
photo. 
You would then build up with other information such as 
parents, 
siblings, 
Member of, 
awards, 
additional photos, and so on.
For an event series, film, podcast or other artistic work, you‚Äôd want to include properties such as 
name, 
alternate names, 
production date, 
production company, 
director, 
screenwriters, 
actors, 
producers and so on. 

AlternateName is incredibly important in all cases. This is because we are all inconsistent and use different names for the same thing. 
For example, I use Jason Barnard and Jason M Barnard. Kalicube uses Kalicube and Kalicube SAS. 
AlternateName allows Google to see these different strings of characters refer to the same entity. So take a good look around the web and make a list and you will almost always use the alternateName field in your Schema :)
Part 3 - For the specific properties that make most sense for your entity, spend some time looking at Schema.org and use your good judgment.
As a general rule you need to include the foundational information that will help Google disambiguate, information that it can use as attributes in the Knowledge Panel and explicit relationships with entities it already recognises. 
To find the properties it is likely to use as attributes in the Knowledge Panel for your Entity take a look at what it shows for Entity Equivalents - that is same entity type, same geo region and same industry. 
To decide which relationships to include, start with the most famous ones and focus on those that are strongest, longest and closest. 
In Kalicube Pro SaaS platform, we generate the Schema and limit ourselves to the properties we KNOW are most important for each entity type.
If you aren‚Äôt using the platform, don‚Äôt worry, we maintain a publicly available up-to-date example of the Schema the Kalicube Pro platform generates for each Entity Type.

Once you have your Schema.org Markup, check it in the Schema checker at https://validator.Schema.org/ to make sure there are no errors, then add the Schema to the Entity Home. 
Generally, it is best to add the Schema to the head section of the HTML. However, adding it in the page itself works fine. 
In Wordpress, for example, you can create an HTML Gutenberg block and copy paste it there. 
If you already have Schema Markup in your page for the entity - if you are using Yoast or RankMath or Wordlift they might have Schema about the publisher or the author - you can merge your Schema with theirs by adding the @id property for the Person or Organization in their Schema Markup to your Schema Markup. 
Find the @id property for the entity in the existing Schema and add the value to your Schema and the two will merge. 
Here‚Äôs an example. I used Yoast on my site and added the @id from Yoast to my hand-written Schema. And the two merge neatly making this VERY clear and simple for Google.
(NOTE TO FAITH - you‚Äôll need an example here on screen. Be sure to ask :)

@type
Person
@type
Organization
@id
https://jasonbarnard.com/#/Schema/person/5f658098a295d28072523357041ee408


Use the @id that you use on the entity home wherever you can around the web. 
The @id supposed to be a unique identifier, but different sites create their own id and that is confusing.
 That said you cannot always do this - but the more it sees the @id from your entity home around the web, the more it will see that as the dominant id.
Ideally Google would have just one unique reference to each named entity. That isn‚Äôt possible. The most stable references for Google are, in this order
Entity Home URL
Google kgmid
The id of your entity on your Entity Home
For other engines, obviously only the first and third apply.
To dig deeper into Schema Markup, the reference site is https://Schema.org - 
I strongly recommend that you take a good look around the Schema.org site and read the articles you'll find in the additional materials of this lesson. 
I also recommend using their Schema validator rather than Google's since their tool is designed to tell you whether your Schema Markup is valid for rich elements and features on their SERP. 
That means they will declare a warning or an error because your Schema will not trigger a rich feature in their SERP rather than because it is not written correctly.

...and it will also declare a warning or an error because your Schema will not trigger a rich feature rather than it not being written correctly. 
Since we are trying to communicate facts to Google's Knowledge algorithms and educate them over a long period of time about 
who we are, 
what we do and 
which audience we serve, 
and thus get in the Knowledge Graph and trigger a Knowledge Panel, 
the bells and whistles of prices and stars in the SERPs is not part of this equation.
One last point. Add this code only to the Entity Home. 
Adding it sitewide would suggest to Google that every page on the website talks 80% or more about this one entity, which is obviously not the case. 
Stick to the Entity Home. This ensures you focus Google‚Äôs attention :)"
Explanation of How to Use Hyperlinks to Get a Knowledge Panel on Google	"Now you have given a clear explanation of the facts on the Entity Home and ensured that the fragmented information about the entity around the web provides consistent corroboration of the facts, you are ready to join the dots.
In short, you need to build an infinite self-confirming loop of corroboration with the Entity Home at the epicenter. You should do that by adding signposts to and from the Entity Home in the form of hyperlinks. 
Joining the dots does three things: 1) it the means by which you get Google to accept that the Entity Home you chose is indeed the correct ‚ÄúPoint of reconciliation‚Äù 2) joining the dots ensures Google understands that each of these references to the Entity around the web is indeed about this specific Named Entity and 3) Google also needs you to show it which references are most important and relevant in the opinion of the Entity. 
Joining the dots is about confidence, trust and reliability. You need to join the dots in order to build its perception of your reliability, and also to provide explicit indications about where to find the corroboration, which will vastly improve Google‚Äôs confidence in its understanding. 
The child has read your description. It understands your description, but it doesn't know if the Entity Home you have chosen is a trustworthy and reliable source or not: It isn‚Äôt convinced that the Entity Home you have chosen is the place it should rely upon in the future moving forwards.
So you need to indicate to it that the webpage does indeed legitimately represent the Entity and that the information the Entity provides about itself on this page is reliable. 
Reliability is all about signposting the first, second and third party sources that accurately corroborate the information you provide on the Entity Home. You should only signpost those sources that are accurate. More is not necessarily better. More consistency is necessarily better, though.
You need to add links from the Entity Home to the first, second and third party sources that corroborate the information you have provided on the Entity Home. You also need to place a hyperlink from the sources to the Entity Home where possible. THAT‚ÄôS your infinite self-confirming loop of corroboration. 
Now, obviously this can get messy and not be very user friendly if there are a lot of corroborative sources. And some simply won‚Äôt be appropriate. Crunchbase might not be something you would want to link to from the homepage on your website. If your Entity Home is your about page, then that is obviously much less of a problem. You need to find the balance between serving Google's needs and your user's needs and not distracting them from actually doing business with you. Using less hyperlink signposts will slow the process of getting a Knowledge Panel, but will not prevent it from happening.
There are several options for anchor text. But don‚Äôt overthink or overdo this. Generally, you would use the Entity name as the anchor text on the links pointing to the Entity Home. Where appropriate for the user, you can use more descriptive anchor texts such as ‚ÄúKalicube‚Äôs site‚Äù or ‚Äúmore about Kalicube‚Äù, or even your foundational semantic triple ‚ÄúKalicube is a digital marketing agency‚Äù.
On the Entity Home, you are going to need to be smart in order to best serve Google without negatively impacting the User Experience. Options for the anchor text for links pointing from the Entity Home to the corroborative sources include;
Just the Entity name, just the platform name, the Entity name plus the platform name ‚ÄúJason Barnard on Twitter‚Äù. You can also integrate the links into the copy using relevant words and phrases - ‚ÄúJason‚Äôs bio on IMDB‚Äù, or ‚Äúon MusicBrainz, Jason Barnard is listed on multiple albums‚Äù. Using semantic triples is ideal. ‚ÄúJason works for Kalicube‚Äù would be perfect for a link from my personal Entity Home to my profile page on my company website (and back, of course :)
Once again, you need to use your judgment and balance the user experience versus the needs of Google. Anchor text is very powerful but Google‚Äôs algorithms are programmed to look out for (and punish) over-optimisation and then this type of technique can look spammy and unprofessional to your audience. 
One option that might make sense in some circumstances is to make an HTML table of the links. For example, having a table with links to the social accounts, another table with profile pages within your industry and a table with articles about the Entity. This presentation might allow you to add more signposts and potentially look better to your users than over-optimising your copywriting. 
Importantly, before joining the dots, you should ensure that all of the sources that you are going to signpost do indeed corroborate what it is you are saying on the Entity Home. 
If you send Google the Child to sources that provide unclear corroboration or information that contradicts what you are saying on the Entity Home, then you are going to confuse the child. As I mentioned earlier, Google sees these visible links on the Entity Home as the sources the Entity itself is recommending. The equivalent of the parent telling the child to ‚Äúgo ask Grandma‚Äù, or ‚Äúgo ask your history teacher‚Äù. 
If you link to authoritative sources that do support your version of the facts, then you are creating an effective infinite self-confirming loop of corroboration with the Entity Home at the epicenter. You will build Google's confidence through pure repetition. 
Taking this further, for Google to truly perceive this as a reliable source of information about the Entity, it is important that the sources you signpost are updated when the information on the Entity Home evolves. Being seen as reliable relies not only on telling the truth but also doing so consistently over time. A quick note - some information on third party sources will not be updatable. In those cases, you need to use your good judgment about whether the value the information on those sources brings due to its authority outweighs any confusion caused by lack of consistency.
One last tip is to ensure that you link to the final URL. Linking to a URL that redirects weakens the signal. For example, even though they end up on the same URL, link to https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonmbarnard/ with a trailing slash rather than https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonmbarnard without.
In conclusion - use links to create the self-confirming loop of corroboration with the Entity Home at the epicenter, and maintain consistency within this loop over time. Google will be going through the entire loop regularly. Let‚Äôs say once a week. So when you update information on one, you must update on them all at the same time. THAT is how you‚Äôll build its trust, it will see this page as a reliable source of information about the Entity from the Entity and, after a year or two, you‚Äôll gain a surprising level of control over the facts Google shows in the Knowledge Panel. 
Schema Markup is a geeky way to add these signposts without the messiness and the problems with the user experience on the page. It also allows you to confirm all the information you provided on the Entity Home, plus some helpful additional details in a format Google can natively digest - its ‚Äúnative language‚Äù, if you like. 
Using Schema Markup is not strictly necessary, and this non-geeky lesson provides the non-geeky methods that do work. But Schema is a great help to Google, so ideally, you‚Äôll do both.
On Kalicube.pro, we offer a simple, free tool that will provide you with the basic Schema Markup you need. You fill in the information and the tool generates the Schema Markup that you can copy paste into the HTML of your Entity Home. If you are using Wordpress, you can simply use an HTML Gutenburg block."
Explanation of How to Leverage Corroboration Sources to get a Knowledge Panel on Google	"You need corroboration from relevant first, second and third party authoritative sites.
There is a simple but important distinction between first, second and third party corroboration.
First party is any webpage you control. Corroboration on these has a very fast rate of diminishing returns. By that I mean, each additional piece of corroboration on a first party site will bring significantly less value than the previous one.
Second party is webpages you partially control. Social profiles, or review platforms, for example where you control parts of the content such as the title and description, but content can be added by others and the actual page is owned and controlled by another party. Corroboration on these has a slower rate of diminishing returns than first party, with each additional corroboration having less value than the last. 
Third party is webpages where you have no control. Articles about the Entity on independent media sites, interviews, appearances on webinars, and any other content that is controlled by an Entity over which you have no control. Corroboration on these has no rate of diminishing returns: each additional corroboration will bring the amount of additional confidence the third party inspires in Google‚Äôs mind. 
Human curated, collaborative sites such as Wikipedia, Wikidata, Crunchbase, IMDB are technically second party, but can be considered to be third party since they are collaborative and ultimate control is with human editors and admins. 
What affects the additional confidence in the understanding for Google? The main factors here are the consistency of information, relevancy and authoritativeness of the source, the number of corroborations, the frequency - sustained corroborative activity around the Entity being helpful.
There is absolutely not a one-rule-fits all here. Each Entity will need different doses of each factor, and each factor will play off each other, as well as Google‚Äôs initial perception of the Entity Identity and related Named Entities. Generally speaking - 30 is a reasonable number to aim for. In terms of proportions, the Second party corroboration will generally dominate quite significantly.
There are simple and general rules you can follow to ensure you are choosing the right corroboration.
To make it easier, here is a table you can use as a guide when deciding what should be added and what should not:

What you shouldn‚Äôt add:
-Outdated profiles that the entity has no control of
-Articles written by the entity that don't contain relevant information about the entity
-Content from dubious and spam sites
-Profiles of other entities
-Social media posts and replies
What you should add:
-Up-to-date profiles controlled by the entity
-Interviews about the entity
-Articles about the history or life of the entity
-Videos exclusively about the entity
But bear in mind that the most important thing is to always remember that you are educating the child that is Google and any corroboration must contain truthful facts about the entity. An article written by the entity can be interesting and impress your audience with a great sales pitch, but if it does not contain relevant factual information about the entity, it isn‚Äôt helpful to Google the child as it tries to understand the facts about you. 
The next thing you should do is to make sure that the different sources of corroboration that you have don‚Äôt contradict each other. Contradictions lead to confusion, and confusion is very troublesome for Google. 

So now that we have established the initial guidelines, you need to start working.

The initial work in making the easiest plate-puzzle for Google is to do a spring clean. Correct all the information on all the first and second party sites. This is usually a massive job that will take weeks, or perhaps months. If you are using Kalicube Pro, then it will be easier and quicker since the platform automatically finds all the corroborative sources, and lists them by order of importance to Google and therefore priority for you.
As for how you will correct the information, many SEOs will worry about duplicate content. They might talk about Google‚Äôs Panda updates, whereby Google penalized duplicate content, when it found multiple versions of the same text around the web. However, in this specific case, duplicate content is actually an advantage.
That repetition is what's going to build the child‚Äôs confidence that the contents of the description on your Entity Home are in fact true. There is no need to worry that there will be repetition on your Brand SERP, Google automatically takes care of that. It will pick and choose and mix and match the parts that it wants to show, so rarely do you get a case where a Brand SERP is overly repetitive. 
And this is also the advantage of the modular system we use at Kalicube. On different platforms around the web, you can use different parts of that modular description, according to the audience that will be reading it. So on Crunchbase, you could potentially use the module about the history of the company and the module about the key people, but not the one about the company‚Äôs podcast. On your Facebook profile, you might want to use the module about the mission statement and the module about customer service. 
The aim isn't to get exactly the same description on every single platform. You will naturally end up with parts of that description on multiple platforms - once again, the fragmented plate analogy‚Ä¶ where all the pieces fit neatly together.
If the descriptions and facts differ from platform to platform, then Google not only has a broken plate problem, it has a problem with a broken plate where the pieces don‚Äôt fit together. Ensuring corroboration around the web is consistent ensures the pieces all fit together correctly and Google can easily and reliably build the complete puzzle that will look exactly like the one you present to it on your Entity Home.
Once you have completed the spring clean, you can expand, obviously prioritising third party content about the entity since corroboration from a relevant, authoritative third party is by far the most powerful. 
When working with third party sites, it is harder to get them to include exactly the description you propose. If you can, that is great since it is a confirmation that an independent source agrees that what you say is true. The important thing is to get at least some of the facts mentioned, so be flexible. 
But whatever the type of site - first, second, or third party - you want to aim to keep the texts clear, use semantic triples and mention closely related Entities where reasonable and possible. A reminder, a semantic triple is simply subject verb object, and a sentence will be clearer for a machine like Google when the sentence is relatively short, well focussed and the subject verb object are close together.
Kalicube provides digital marketing services. Jason Barnard works at Kalicube. Those are both semantic triples. The sentences are VERY short. Too short, of course.
So, if a third party such as Entrepreneur.com were to write this: ‚ÄúBased in France, Kalicube provides digital marketing services to businesses who want to control their brand message on Google‚Äù I would be very happy. We have the semantic triple that describes what we do, an explanation of who we serve and what we offer them, the location (which helps with disambiguation)‚Ä¶ and also, rather cheekily, a mention of a related Entity: Google itself!
Repetition of what you are saying on the Entity Home on first, second and third party sources will build Google confidence in its understanding. 
And always remember first party sites will have a very fast rate of diminishing returns in terms of building confidence, second party websites will have a slower rate of diminishing returns and third party sites will tend to have a low rate of diminishing returns. 
That means, after you've done the spring clean and ensured a consistency on first and second party sites, building Google‚Äôs confidence will be part of an ongoing digital PR strategy aimed at positive, accurate corroboration on relevant third party sites.
On Kalicube Pro we offer a list of third party sites that Google trusts. You can filter by country and by industry. It is absolutely NOT a definitive or complete list. But it will give you some initial targets and a good idea of what type of site Google is looking at in your industry.
You‚Äôll notice that Kalicube sites, and my own personal site appears in this list regularly. This is because over the years, we have built Google‚Äôs trust in us for our industry and therefore Google sees us as an authority and trusts what we say about entities in our industry.
Finally, a word of warning about spam. There are services that will create literally hundreds of second party profiles for you. That is not a good idea because, after the first half a dozen, a fast rate of diminishing returns will kick in and those profiles are going to be VERY weak. They're going to bring very, very little value - probably no value at all. 
Even if this strategy might sometimes work short term, they will be very difficult for you to maintain over time. As your Entity evolves, the facts and therefore your description changes, and you will forget to update many of these profiles. That will mean inconsistency and contradiction for Google. And Google the Child hates that !
Lastly, since over time, there will be little or no activity, and no audience engagement, Google will see this, identify them as spam and that will damage your credibility - Google hates spam. 
Another warning is to be aware of websites that try to trick the machine. Some of them do it. Wikitia has done a good job of tricking the machine, but Google has a massive team dedicated to cleaning up Knowledge Panel spam, through manual intervention on a case by case basis, plus a HUGE investment in Machine Learning for the Knowledge graph and the SERPs. 
You will be coming at this from the perspective of the Entity Home and your initial description about who you are, what you do and which audience you serve. Google the Child now has that information from the parent, and is trying to figure out which other sources it can trust. Brothers, Sister, Grandmother would represent Second Party sites in this analogy. Teachers, community leaders and so on would represent Wikipedia, IMDB and other sources the child has been told it can trust. 
For the rest of the world wide web - the scary wider world in our child analogy - Google is training their algorithm to judge for itself. We are in the early days, and sometimes the child can be tricked. Google cannot allow this child to be tricked too often - if it gets information wrong now, or trusts the wrong sources, then it will get progressively worse as time goes by. 
Google‚Äôs entire business model depends on building a Knowledge Graph (the machine-readable Encyclopedia I mentioned in the first lesson). It needs to understand the world in order to be able to match its users' needs to the most effective solutions provided by different entities, your company, or yourself.
Knowledge spam management is already a huge priority for Google. It is definitely going to become an even bigger focus for them over the coming years. 
Knowledge Spam reminds me of link building. Creating massive numbers of phony, spammy links on second rate websites used to trick Google. The engineers then implemented the Penguin updates and now have this under control in the core algorithms. Something very similar is going to happen with Knowledge Panels.
There will always be short term cheats and tricks you can play. But long term, I don‚Äôt see why you wouldn‚Äôt do this properly."
Explanation of How to Write the Perfect Entity Description for a Google Knowledge Panel	"After the Entity Home, the second most important thing is the Entity description. This might seem surprising - most people think Schema Markup is the most important thing, but it is actually only fourth on the list :) 
Since the very beginning back in 1998, Google has been text based. It used to simply count words, today it uses NLP (Natural Language Processing) to understand the text. So you need to write a description about your entity that Google can understand. And since this is a description that you‚Äôll be using across all your profiles as well as on the Entity Home, it needs to also be attractive to your human audience.
In our ‚ÄúGoogle as a child‚Äù analogy, the child needs a solid foundational explanation from the parent before going to get corroboration from grandmother, sister, brother, baker, history teacher. If it doesn‚Äôt have a foundational understanding of the basic facts, it will be much more difficult for the child to learn. 
So take the time to write a clear, compelling Entity description. This description will be visible online in multiple places so your audience will also read it. You need to find that balance between being clear for Google by speaking in simple language, with simple sentence structure whilst also ensuring that the content and the way you write is attractive and appealing to your audience.
The child needs a simple, clear lesson, so your copy needs to be well structured and set out in a way that each topic is covered in a dedicated specific paragraph, or module: each paragraph covers one aspect of the Entity and explains it. 
The heading is the Entity name, or ‚ÄúAbout {Entity Name}‚Äù or ‚ÄúWho is ‚ÄúEntity Name}‚Äù. The heading can be a little more adventurous than that. But not much :)
The next sentence MUST be a semantic triple that describes the principle activity of the Entity. Semantic triple sounds complicated but it is just a fancy way of saying ‚Äúsubject->verb->object‚Äù. The rest of that first sentence should expand on the specific topicality the entity is known for.

So: ‚ÄúKalicube is a digital marketing agency that is pioneering Brand SERP optimisation and Knowledge Panel management‚Äù is a helpful start to an Entity description. Kalicube (subject) is (verb) a digital marketing agency (object).
So: ‚ÄúJason Barnard is an author, a digital marketer, a musician and a cartoon blue dog‚Äù is also a helpful start to an Entity description. Jason (subject) is (verb) an author (object). 
Importantly, the object MUST be the subtitle you want to see in the Knowledge Panel. So ‚ÄúJason Barnard is an author, a digital marketer, a musician and a cartoon blue dog‚Äù would suggest to Google that ‚Äúauthor‚Äù is the correct subtitle to use. ‚ÄúJason Barnard is a musician, a digital marketer, an author and a cartoon blue dog‚Äù would suggest to Google that ‚Äúmusician‚Äù is the correct subtitle to use.
Using this starting phrase on every relevant first, second and third party source of corroboration will reassure the child and build its confidence in the understanding of the basics.
Pay attention to proper nouns. Capitalising a word or set of words will suggest to Google that they are proper nouns. Since proper nouns are, in effect, Entities and a huge amount of the analysis Google does to understand a text is based on Entities and relationships (aka proper nouns and verbs) Google is very sensitive to capitalisation of words within a text. An example I use in the Brand SERPs course is ‚Äúyellow door‚Äù - in all lower cases, it means a door that is yellow - if we capitalise the Y and the D, it becomes a Names Entity - a company or a brand name, the name of a rock group, a song, or perhaps a caf√© in New York.
Write the description in multiple modules. Each module should focus on one aspect of the facts about the entity. This has two advantages: it is easier for Google to understand when things are clearly segmented, and it creates a modular system whereby, when you are adding the description to other web pages about the entity, you can reorder or remove ‚Äúchunks‚Äù that aren‚Äôt relevant for that audience.
Each module needs a title that you can use as a heading when formatting the text is possible, but becomes a pseudo-heading where formatting is not possible (on Crunchbase, for example). Repeating the entity name and using semantic triples in the pseudo-headings is helpful for Google, but becomes annoying for the user. You need to find the balance that makes sense.
The order of the modules on your Entity Home is important. Start with the important aspects today, and end with the history, when the company was founded, when the person was born or grew up, or the date the music group played their first gig.
Google reads from top to bottom and understands that what comes first is most important and relevant today, and that what comes last is least important today. Same thing for your audience, if they REALLY want to know when you were born, they will read to the bottom, but generally speaking, people want to know what you do today. 
Think of it as the life of the entity split into chapters and told backwards :)
Google and most human beings are most interested in what we are doing today. It is the same thing for a Person: I was born in 1966 in the north of Yorkshire, then I was a musician in a punk-folk band, then a cartoon blue dog and I am now a digital marketer. That, of course, is the wrong way around.
For Kalicube‚Äôs description, the first chapter focuses on our products and services, then we have a module dedicated to the Kalicube Pro SaaS platform, then we describe  the audiences we serve and our clientele (with some mentions of our success stories), then our free resources, then who the key people are, then the date and place founded, finally segueing into why I founded the company and our mission statement.
Using this description (or parts of it) on every single page dedicated to the Entity helps Google enormously - in order to become confident in its understanding, it needs to see the message over and over and over again, like a child. Understanding is one thing. Confidence in that understanding is another. This repetition builds confidence.
Forget any doubts you have about duplicate content and Google‚Äôs Panda update. This is an exception for Google. But also think about your brand message and your human audience. You want to project a consistent brand message, and your audience expects to see a similar or the same message on multiple platforms. 
The modularity of the description overcomes the problem of different audiences on different platforms and specific limitations of different platforms. LinkedIn uses a short description, then a timeline, and the audience is B2B, so you would place the business modules at the top. IMDB is all about films, actors, podcasts and the entertainment industry, so you would lead with TV shows and podcasts. Twitter or Instagram are more B2C and ‚Äúhuman to human‚Äù, so you would adapt that first presentation phrase to something more attractive to users‚Ä¶ Use your good judgement - Google doesn‚Äôt NEED to see exactly the same message everywhere, it doesn‚Äôt need to see all the facts every time, but it does need consistency in the information. 
Think back to the broken plate analogy from the previous lessons - the plate will still be broken, but all the pieces will fit perfectly and the fully completed plate puzzle on the Entity Home is the point of reference. 
How do you know Google can understand your text, once it is written? Kalicube Pro has a tool that analyses the text in depth using Google‚Äôs own NLP. Here is a screenshot. That allows us to formulate the description very precisely. Here we can see that Google clearly understands the context - it has categorised correctly and it is confident - and it has also recognised the dominant Entity and several highly relevant entities too.
You can use any other Natural Language Processing to analyse your description. But here we see Google's understanding, whereas if we use another NLP, the understanding that we would see reflected from that analysis would be less relevant to Google results. 

An important tip here is not to obsess about making sure that Google's own NLP understands every word in your description, as Google's understanding of the world changes very often. You should focus on writing a clear, consistent, factual and modular description that Google will understand itself over time by corroboration and putting the broken pieces of the plate back together.
One last point is that, if the Entity Home is a dedicated ‚Äúabout‚Äù page, then adding the entire description makes sense to your audience and to Google. If the Entity Home is the homepage, you would probably not want to add the entire description to your page. You need to be pragmatic here. Your homepage is there to ‚Äúcharm‚Äù your users, and guide them to the place on the website they want to get to. 
Having this very long text on that page is not going to be good for your users. What you can do is use only the first phrase, or just the most relevant modules, or you could summarise the text in one short unique paragraph - just be sure that the facts are consistent with the description you place on the ‚Äúabout‚Äù page and profile pages for the entity. 
Importantly, even if your homepage is the Entity Home, you must still create a dedicated ‚Äúabout‚Äù page with the full description. You should also link to that ‚Äúabout‚Äù page from the menu and / or footer.
If you are using Schema Markup (which I strongly recommend), the fact that the Schema Markup description does not exactly match the description on the page itself does not matter because Google understands that this is the situation: it will see the full version on the ‚Äúabout‚Äù page and repeated around the web. 
In conclusion, the Entity description is PHENOMENALLY important and often vastly underrated. The full Entity Description is the foundation of Google‚Äôs understanding. It is the completed plate puzzle Google uses as a reference. It is the parent‚Äôs explanation of the facts. 
But your explanation alone isn't enough. Google needs corroboration. We'll look at that next."
Explanation of Entity Home and How it Helps with Getting a Knowledge Panel on Google SERPs	"The Entity Home. What is an Entity Home? An Entity Home simply put is one single point of reference for Google to reconcile all the information about you on phones around the web, reconciling means double checking the information that it has found against a source from the Entity itself. The Entity Home is 100% the single most important thing about controlling your Entity Identity in Google and controlling. Google's understanding of your Entity, your Entity Identity is the foundation stone for all of Google's representation of you within its SERPs.
Including, obviously, the Knowledge Panel, which is simply the most visible representation that Google has. So using the Knowledge Panel to understand how well Google has actually understood you is incredibly important.
Now it seems obvious that the Entity. Should be on your own website. And Google has probably guessed that it's on your website. It's probably guessed which website represents the Entity. It's probably even guess which page on that website represents that particular Entity, but that doesn't mean it's confident you need to help it become confident.
And the process of corroboration and the eternal self corroborating loop that I talked about in the previous lesson is how it becomes confident that this is indeed the Entity Home. Now, first thing is what does the Entity Home contain? It contains a simple factual explanation from the Entity itself in English.
We say from the horse's mouth or British English, we say from the horse's mouth. So it's your explanation to Google and indeed to your audience of who you are, what you do and who your audience. And how you can be helpful to them and why you might be a credible solution for specific problems that they might have.
Now, if the Entity Home is 100%, the most important thing in the entire process of controlling your Entity Identity, as concerns Google, you need to own the Entity Home. Some Entity homes are on social media profiles, Twitter, for example, that is not a viable solution long term. If you want to be able to control your brand message on Google's SERPs throughout the Google stratosphere, because if you do not own the Entity Home, the Entity Home could pass into the hands of somebody. And they would therefore control your Entity Identity in Google's eyes, or it could be removed by the site owner, or they could change it to something that does not represent your Entity. You need to own the foundational stone of Google's understanding of who you are, what you do and who your audience is.
Google will generally default to the homepage of the website that represents the company when it's a company. If it's a person, it will default to the homepage of the personal website of that person. If that person does not have a website, if they are famous, it will default to one of their social media profiles.
If they are not famous, it will probably not find an Entity Home, at least for the moment. If the Entity is a sub Entity of another Entity, I a close relation that does not have a dedicated site for itself. And an example here would be the CEO of a company who does not have his or her own personal website.
Then the Entity Home would potentially be the about page for that person on the company website, ideally for every. The Entity Home would be an about page on the website that represents that Entity owned by that Entity. However, that isn't always possible. Google's default is something that you need to follow at least for the moment in 2022. I wouldn't imagine that Google will be subtle enough to be able to fully understand oriented homes for several.
However, if you have an Entity Home. So if you have a website that represents, for example, a music group is a very good example. The mu the website represents the music group and the two members of that music group. In this case, Kate Westbrook and Mike Westbrook each have their own page. And Google has recognized each of their Entity homes as being the page that is specifically about them as a sub.
Of the Westbrook jazz, uh, Entity on an Entity Home, there are two different types of content. There is the visible content and the invisible content, the visible content, obviously the content of the page, the text, the images and the links. The text is your explanation of who you are, what you're doing, who your audience. In as clear, a manner as possible, that is also attractive to your audience, your human audience, the images are the ones that you want, Google and your audience.
So you want Google to use and that you think will please and attract your audience. And the links are the links to the important, uh, pages that represent your. Externally or internally that are actually going to be interesting to your human audience. Everything visible on that page should be of interest and helpful and valuable to your audience when they're on that page, researching your Entity and for the invisible content behind the scenes, there is an entire set of text of images and of links that is in schema markup format.
Human beings will not see. And it is the information. The human beings are seen, represented to Google in what we can consider to be its native language schema markup, which is the way that it can natively and confidently digest this visible inform. And the trick here as well, is that the invisible content, the schema market behind the scenes in Google's native language can contain additional details and additional information that is not visible on the page.
And that is absolutely fine. So I invite you to watch the joining the dots lesson for more about the invisible content. Now in terms of the visible content, incredibly important to keep a great balance between the user and the machine. Obviously we want to educate this child with his Google. We want to make sure it understands a, that this is the Entity Home B, that we are being honest about ourselves and C that the information is.
uh, understandable to Google, but we also want the user reading this page to get value from it. So the content that we add needs to be helpful, valuable, and relevant to them, whether it's text images or links, if it's on the homepage, if your Entity Home is on the homepage, focus on the user and the user navigation where they want to go.
A homepage on your company website or your personal website or your band website, or your podcast website is all about where your audience wants to go. If they have ended up on that homepage, it's because they're going somewhere else. So you need to be sure that you are very clear about what, who you are and what you offer to them, but also where they could potentially wish to go next.
You need to be helpful to your audience. So you really need to focus on that Google. If it has identified your, your homepage as your Entity Home already has a strong understanding of who you are and what you do. And the joining of the dots is behind the scenes is going to be enough. So focus on the user.
If it's on an about page, you can focus more on the machine, which makes it easier and faster, um, to educate Google. When the page is dedicated to educating Google and not a dual functional webpage, which the homepage necessarily is. So you cannot mess up your homepage in order to, just to educate Google
and with the about page. If you can get the Entity Home on an about page, a dedicated page, which is for the machines, then this leads you to more controls. Since you can tweak the text, the content, the images to educate the machine rather than to attract and please your audience. But don't fight Google, go with the flow.
If it has chosen the homepage, accept it, stabilize it. And a few years down the line, we will figure out how to change the Entity Home from the homepage to a dedicated about page, which will make life better for absolutely. Everyone and always remember the Entity Home is the most important thing it's from here that Google will get understanding of who you are, what you do and who your audience is.
And it's from here that you will be able to signpost it to the amazing third party corroboration on trusted and or authoritative sites to prove to Google that what you are saying is true to prove to Google that this is indeed the Entity Home, and to build Google's confidence in its understanding.
Confidence in the understanding that Google has is what is going to drive everything in SEO, your Knowledge Panel, Google SERPs in general and something."
Explanation of the Three Simple Steps to Get a Knowledge Panel on Google	"There are three very simple steps to getting a Knowledge Panel. The same three steps also apply to correcting, enhancing and stabilising the presence of a Knowledge Panel. So keep watching even if you have a Knowledge Panel.
Number 1 - Provide Google with your version of the facts.
Number 2 - Ensure that version of the facts is corroborated on multiple trusted authoritative sources. 
Number 3 - Signpost supporting evidence so that Google trusts you.
Simple ! A word of warning though. Be patient. Google is quite slow at understanding. And even slower at being confident in that understanding. When it shows a Knowledge Panel on the right hand side, it's showing what it considers to be facts, and it doesn‚Äôt want to get them wrong. So it will always be very, very cautious.
The first and by far most important trick is absolutely ALWAYS your Entity Home. Ironically, Google is looking for the version of the facts about you, from you. A surprisingly large part of this course is how to ensure it recognises you as an authority about yourself. Sounds strange. But believe me, it works. 
Google wants to hear from you: who you are, what you do and which audience you serve. When you get this right, you set the foundational understanding in Google‚Äôs brain. You get to decide how it understands you, your offers and your relationship with your audience. Google knows which website is yours. But you need to convince it to trust the information you provide.
The second trick is to find out which first, second and third party sources Google trusts for information about you. First party sites are those that you own and fully control. Second Party sites are those that you partially control the content but do not own the website: for example Twitter, Linkedin, review sites like Trustpilot, or an industry site where you have a profile page. Third party sites are those where you have no control, for example articles and videos about you by bloggers and journalists. If you can figure out which of each type of site is relevant for the entity, then you know where to correct information that already exists and add additional corroborative information that will help educate Google and build up its confidence.
The third trick is to signpost. You need to link from your webpage to the trusted and authoritative corroboration sources, and signpost Google from them back to your Entity Home. 
Explained like that, this is all incredibly simple. And it is. This is absolutely not rocket science. It is definitely something any marketer or brand manager can do. You could stop this course now and apply the strategies I have already outlined and get into Google‚Äôs Knowledge Graph and get a Knowledge Panel.
Why continue with the course? Because, as with everything that is worth doing, it is worth doing well. And also, as with everything that seems very simple, there are hundreds of caveats, exceptions and pitfalls that could trip you up. One thing I have learned since 2012 when I started working on Google‚Äôs understanding of the world through its Knowledge Graph and Knowledge Panels is that when you get things wrong, recovery takes years, rather than weeks or months. 
If you are thinking that Wikipedia, Wikidata, EverybodyWiki or Wikitia are the solution, then think again. I have tried them all. And learned some hard, difficult lessons. Each can trigger a Knowledge Panel short term, but none is necessary, none is necessarily helpful and each can present you with problems further down the line, as you‚Äôll see in this course.
Other sites such as IMDB, MusicBrainz, LinkedIn, DNB and Crunchbase provide massive opportunities and are incredibly powerful when you use them appropriately. And that is incredibly important. Knowledge Panels are MAJORITARILY filled with information that is not from the Wikis‚Ä¶ Google uses the entire web to populate your Knowledge Panel. And your industry and geo-region play a HUGE role in terms of sources that Google uses for the information it displays Knowledge Panels.
When there IS a Wikipedia page, information from there will dominate. So effectively, control of the contents of your Knowledge Panel is mostly with Wikipedia editors, not you. 
Also remember that to get a Wikipedia article or a Wikidata page you need to be notable. And since they both aim to be helpful to humans, that makes sense. For its Knowledge Graph and Knowledge Panels, Google simply doesn‚Äôt care about notability. Everyone is welcome !
So, you don't need to be notable, but you DO need to be visible and you do need that visibility to be clear and unambiguous. 
Getting and managing a Knowledge Panel is 100% about you being clear and unambiguous on every platform you can, starting with your own website. 
So, once again, that three step process:
Number 1 - Provide Google with your version of the facts on your Entity Home. I‚Äôll explain more about the entity home and how to clearly present your version of the facts in the next lessons.
Number 2 - Ensure that version of the facts is corroborated on multiple RELEVANT, trusted authoritative sources. This is the topic of the following lesson dedicated to the best strategies for corroboration.
Number 3 - Signpost supporting evidence so that Google trusts you. You can do this using simple links, which I explain in a dedicated lesson on joining the dots for non-geeks, and you can also use Schema.org markup, which is the subject of a dedicated lesson. And, although it might seem very geeky, I would suggest you look into Schema markup even if code scares you. We have simple-to-use free tools on Kalicube Pro that will generate the Schema.org markup for you.
To summarise, starting with your own website, you HAVE TO be clear about who you are, what you offer and which audience you serve with your content, products and services. Then you need to ensure that a clear message is repeated on every single first, second and third party website that talks about you. 
THAT is the trick to getting into Google‚Äôs Knowledge Graph and triggering a Knowledge Panel on Google for a search query on your brand or personal name."
Explanation of the Strategy for Getting a Google Knowledge Panel	"Google is a child thirsty for knowledge, and you need to educate it. In the introduction to this course I talked about this idea very briefly. We have an entire lesson about this because the concept is so fundamental to Knowledge Panels. 
Google wants to understand the entire world and that's a massive task. Google has built an algorithm that is capable of using the information it finds on the world wide web to learn about the world. And it is increasingly able to learn on its own.
Of course, it started with human curated databases, including Wikipedia. Google fed the algorithm with information from Wikipedia, Freebase, Wikidata, IMDB, MusicBrainz and other sources that Google engineers considered to be reliable. The Machine Learning algorithms have been trained on this reliable human curated data. In recent years, the Google engineers have tested the child-alorithm‚Äôs capacity to deduce facts from the information it finds on the web - the simple trick has been to compare the information it deduces from the world wide web to the information in Freebase, Wikidata and Wikipedia. 
Since 2020, the algorithms have become increasingly reliable and little by little, the child is learning to learn from the fragmented information it finds on the web. That is HUGE.
So, the algorithm increasingly learns on its own. But that doesn't mean to say we should allow it free reign. We can help it learn by actively educating it. We can teach Google. Now that is SUPER HUGE.
Basically there are just three simple steps. Number one is the Entity Home. It's the webpage that Google uses as a reference for information about an Entity from that Entity: your version of the facts. Number two, it looks at corroboration. It wants to be sure that you are telling the truth and that your version is an accurate representation. To do that, it compares the information you provided on the Entity Home to all the information around the web that it can find. Number three, you need to guide the child. Ideally, it will start at the Entity Home, see your explanation, then you will link to the other corroborative sources that confirm the explanation and link back to the Entity Home. The child is then in an eternal cycle of self corroboration.
It might seem strange that Google is looking actively for an Entity Home - Google calls this the ‚Äúpoint of reconciliation‚Äù. The child-algorithm wants your version of the facts in order to be able to reconcile the fragmented information it finds around the web into a version that makes sense and is reliable. 
Since not everybody is notable enough to have a Wikipedia article or a Wikidata page, Google cannot rely on those over time. It can‚Äôt rely on IMDB or MusicBrainz either. Even if these platforms would like to be a complete source of information about their topics, they cannot be exhaustive since human editors cannot cover the entire topic exhaustively.
So, if it is to understand the entire world, Google has to build that understanding by finding the Entity Home for every entity, and cross-check the information provided there with authoritative sources. Simple !
We can look at this with an analogy that really makes sense. Google is a child that wants to understand EVERYTHING. In this scenario, you are the parent teaching the child about your little corner of the world. The child looks to the parent for a clear explanation about a fact, the parent explains to the child in simple terms - the explanation you provide on the Entity Home - so the child has a clear understanding of the facts about you.
But that's not enough. The child has other influences: siblings, school teacher, grandparents, friends. 
Hopefully, these people confirm the facts you have provided and that corroboration supports the child‚Äôs learning and builds confidence in the facts in the child‚Äôs mind.
So, your role as parent is to explain on the Entity Home, and then indicate WHICH sources the child should look to for corroboration. It is your job to push the child-algorithm to the reliable, relevant and authoritative sources that confirm the facts. 
In our analogy, if the parent is teaching the child about history, then you would want to push the child towards the history teacher at school since that person is expert, authoritative and trustworthy. You might also want to push the child towards a trusted older sibling or a grandparent for corroboration. The child could also ask the baker, but that baker has very little expertise or authority on the topic of history compared to the history teacher at school.
That said, if the topic was how to bake a cake, the baker would have more Authority than the history teacher. So the key to educating Google is that you identify corroborative sources that have topical authority, expertise and trustworthiness.
Obviously this number is not absolute, but the child is looking for 30 corroborations from trusted, authoritative sources. Close family is great, but preferably a relative, authoritative and trusted expert as in the case of the history lesson from the history teacher or the cake baking lesson from the baker.
After those repetitions, assuming all of these different people repeat more or less the same thing in more or less the same words, the child will not only understand, but it will be incredibly confident in its understanding. 
But the child always needs the go-to source for when information changes or when it has a doubt. And that source is always the parent. That is the Entity Home, the point of reconciliation. It NEEDS that point of reference from you. 
When you say on the Entity Home, the facts are A, B, C. If the corroboration around the world wide web says the information is indeed A, B, C, then the child will understand and be confident in its understanding and trigger a Knowledge Panel. 
However if you say on the Entity Home, the facts are A, B, C and the information around the web sometimes C, D, E, F and sometimes says B F D, then the child will be confused. It won't fully understand. It might believe the parent, but it certainly won't be confident in any of its understanding if everybody else is contradicting you. 
The HUGE question here is what corroboration will this child trust and believe for your entity? You probably immediately jump to the big hitters - Wikipedia, the New York Time, the BBC‚Ä¶ but coming back to our example with history - the History Channel is a great source. For baking cakes, sallysbakingaddiction.com is a super-helpful source. 
So, for corroboration, you need to look for sources that are expert, authoritative and trustworthy within your specialization, your geo region, and for your Entity type.
At Kalicube, we call this Entity Equivalents. So if I want to feed Google factual information about a person in the UK in gardening, I would need to look where Google is getting its information about other people in the UK, in the gardening industry. If I want to feed Google factual information about a company in the US pet food industry, I would need to look where Google is getting its information about other companies in the US, in the pet food industry.
This seems obvious. The trick is to find those sources Google is looking at for that combination of entity type, geo region and industry. That is what the Kalicube Pro SaaS platform is designed for.
That said, there is no need to pay for Kalicube Pro - if you know your industry, you probably instinctively already know which ‚Äúpower sources'' you need to focus on. For a gardener in Leeds in the UK, the gardeners association of the UK, the local newspaper, garden focussed shopping guides in the UK, local fetes and events. 
In short, the trick here is to find where Google is getting the information for its Knowledge Graph and Knowledge Panels for your entity type, within your industry, and in your Geo region‚Ä¶ Google‚Äôs algorithms are very, very specific and hyper focussed. An expert, authoritative and trustworthy entity equivalent source will often be more effective than the traditional mass media sources such as Wikipedia, the New York Times ‚Ä¶
That is Kalicube‚Äôs Entity Equivalent trick and it works every time. 
Now once you have these sources of corroboration, you need to join the dots. Joining the dots can take multiple forms including schema markup, simple hyperlinks, and semantic triples.
I‚Äôll explain each of these in the following lessons. Schema markup is geeky, links are semi-geeky and semantic triples are as simple as pie. You can use them all, or just those you are comfortable with. 
Applying all three will be by far most effective, but if you aren‚Äôt technically minded, you can still educate Google and make this work for you.
Always bear in mind - Google is a child and it simply wants to understand. It is up to you to educate Google about yourself so that it understands and is sufficiently confident in its understanding to give you a Knowledge Panel."
Explanation of Why You Want to Have a Google Knowledge Panel and an Overview of the Best Strategy to get one	"Welcome to the Knowledge Panel Course. I‚Äôm Jason Barnard and I‚Äôm your tutor. I have been studying, experimenting and tracking thousands of Knowledge Panels for over 10 years. I waited until 2022 to record this course because I am now sure I have mastered the art and science of triggering, correcting and enhancing Knowledge Panels on Google. 
Importantly, before we get started, some definitions so that we are on the same page:
A Knowledge Panel is what appears on the right hand side of a desktop search. It is the representation of Google's understanding of that Entity. I will focus on desktop Knowledge Panels for this course - on mobile, Google shows more or less the same information, but the layout is different.
A Knowledge Graph is a machine-readable encyclopedia. These are often human curated (ie people add the information manually).
Google‚Äôs Knowledge Vault, which I also refer to as the Main Knowledge Graph, is the ultimate aim for us all. It is a huge Knowledge Graph containing 150 Billion facts that was initially filled with human curated information, but is now being filled with facts that are determined purely by Google‚Äôs Knowledge algorithms. Google‚Äôs aim is to fill this with all human knowledge. This means that as soon as Google is confident of its understanding about an entity, it moves all the information it has about that entity from the Knowledge Graph to the Knowledge Vault so that it is regarded by the algorithm as indisputable truth.
Ultimately, this course will teach you to add the information about your small corner of the world to Google‚Äôs huge project, and leverage that in the form of a Knowledge Panel.

An Entity is a ‚Äúthing‚Äù - a company, a person, a music group, a product, a film, a podcast or anything else we as humans understand as things :) 
Entity Identity is Google‚Äôs understanding of who you are, what you offer and which audience you serve: it‚Äôs understanding of the facts about the entity. This is a term my friend Koray Gubur coined. Google's representation of the Entity Identity is the Knowledge Panel and Brand SERP.
Entity Home is the page on the internet that Google‚Äôs algorithms look to for information about the Entity from the Entity.
Right Rail and Left Rail. On Google the Left rail is the left hand side of the search results on Desktop - we can look at this as Google‚Äôs recommendations. The Right Rail is the right hand side - we can look at this as the facts according to Google. Since both are mixed together on Mobile, this distinction is only clear on Desktop search, we will focus on that in this course.
This course is about Knowledge Panels. To FULLY optimise Google's perception and its presentation of your Entity Identity, then you should also take the Brand SERP course on Kalicube Academy or read my book The Fundamentals of Brand SERPs for Business.
Before we start, here is my Brand SERP with the Knowledge Panel over there on the right. I have been working on this for 10 years, so it is unusually rich for someone who isn‚Äôt a movie star or famous musician. But it does give you an idea of what can be achieved using the Brand SERP and Knowledge Panel strategies and techniques I teach.

Now, let‚Äôs get started:
Google shows a Knowledge Panel when the search query is specifically about an entity. Google has specifically designed Knowledge Panels as a factual summary of what the user would want to know about the named entity they just searched for.
That means Google wants to show a summary of what it considers to be the important facts about the person, company, product, podcast, film, book, music group or whatever. 
The HUGE question is: ‚Äúwhat does Google consider to be facts‚Äù? Simply stated, what it shows on the left hand side of a search result on desktop is its RECOMMENDATION, what it shows on the RIGHT hand side is what it considers FACT.
This entire course is designed to help you establish the facts about your entity in Google‚Äôs mind so that it shows an accurate and positive summary in the Knowledge Panel on the right hand side when your audience googles your personal or brand name. The most popular will be Knowledge Panels for people and companies, but the course also covers music groups, podcasts, films, books and any other entity, or thing, for which Google might show in a Knowledge Panel.
And the strategies I share in this course work for anyone, anything and everything since Google simply wants to understand. With the tactics, techniques and strategies I teach in this course, getting Google to understand is child‚Äôs play.
So, why and when does Google show Knowledge Panels? The short answer is that Google shows Knowledge Panels when it thinks it has understood the facts. And that is key. Google‚Äôs Knowledge Graph is simply a massive machine readable Encyclopedia. Like Wikipedia but literally millions of times bigger. If you want a Knowledge Panel that accurately represents you or your company, then you need to be proactive.
To understand the sheer scale of Google‚Äôs Knowledge Graph, here are some numbers: Wikipedia has about 50 million articles. Google's Knowledge Graph contains at least 1,500 billion facts as of 2022. And the information in its Knowledge Graph is growing exponentially. So in a few years, Google‚Äôs Knowledge Graph will contain hundreds of thousands of billions of facts. At that scale, as humans we no longer have a grasp, and our best bet is to focus on what it understands about US. And what it understands about you, your business, your music group, your book or whatever will be the single most important thing in your online digital strategy, whatever channel is most important today.
The first incredibly important thing to bear in mind throughout this course is that Google uses its Knowledge Graph in every single one of its search results. Not only in the Knowledge Panel, as we can see here, but also in carousels, entity boxes, People Also Ask and EVERY SINGLE analysis it makes of the content you provide.
Always remember that Google is trying to deliver the best answer to its user‚Äôs question, the best solution to their problem. So its foundational aim is to understand every single offer out there from every single publisher and every single author. Google‚Äôs full and confident understanding of who you are and what you offer should be all you care about. And Knowledge Panels are an indication that it has understood and that it is confident in that understanding.
Now, a quick comparison between Wikipedia and Google‚Äôs Knowledge Graph. Wikipedia is based on the idea of Notability and importance. The litmus test is that people will spontaneously search for you or for your company to find out more about you in an encyclopedic manner. 
Google is simply trying to accumulate every single fact it can about the world so that it can best serve its users.
All you need to do is educate Google. Google wants to understand who you are. It wants to understand what you offer. And it wants to understand which audience you serve because it is aiming to match the best offer (hopefully yours) from the best provider (hopefully you) to the person asking the question or presenting the problem - aka your audience.
So when your audience asks a relevant question to which you have the perfect answer, the Knowledge Panel is foundational since it represents Google‚Äôs understanding of who you are and what you offer.
Google‚Äôs understanding of the world is its Knowledge Graph. The measurable representation of its understanding is the Knowledge Panel. This entire course will teach you how you can educate Google so that it can better understand who you are and what you offer and represent your brand to your science in the way that you want in the Right Rail. 
The aim of this course is to help you avoid all the mistakes I made and deliver solid, sustainable results in just a few weeks.
Always remember that a Knowledge Panel showing up on a search on your name is HUGE. Google shows a Knowledge Panel based on: 

Google‚Äôs understanding of the information about you

Google‚Äôs Confidence in that understanding 

Its assessment of the probability that the searcher is looking for you (famousness)

But if your Knowledge Panel doesn‚Äôt appear on a brand search, that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean your Knowledge Pane does not exist. Knowledge Panels can exist somewhere in Google's brain, but it doesn‚Äôt show it when your audience googles your brand name. That might be because:

The name is ambiguous;

The geolocation of the user implies that you aren‚Äôt relevant; 

Google doesn‚Äôt have sufficient confidence in its understanding;

You are not notable (famous) enough

So, in order to have a Knowledge Panel and get it to trigger when your audience googles your name, you need to ensure that Google understands who you are, what you do and which audience you serve‚Ä¶. But also that it is incredibly confident in that understanding and that you are relevant to its user (wherever and whoever they may be).
In this course, I will talk a lot about Google as a child. The course is all about how we can educate this child and get the information we want into its ‚Äúbrain‚Äù. For the most part it is very simple. 
However, there is a massive complication: it isn't as simple as just one single Knowledge Graph. Most people believe that Google has only one Knowledge Graph. In fact, there are multiple vertical knowledge graphs that Google uses to trigger Knowledge Panels, and the HUGE trick you need to play short term is to pick the right opportunity.
Long term, the ultimate aim is to get into Google's Knowledge Vault. This Course will teach you both to get a Knowledge Panel short term, but also how to get into Google‚Äôs Knowledge Vault and have a Knowledge Panel for life‚Ä¶ importantly, a stable Knowledge Panel that you can control to a large extent. 
Over ten years of getting this right for ourselves and our clients, at Kalicube we know that the ‚Äútrick‚Äù is to:

get yourself in one of the verticals, 

move yourself across into the main Knowledge Vault 

Build confidence for long term stability.

So in this course, I will explain to you which opportunities are reasonable (given your situation), which tactics, techniques and strategies will work to get a Knowledge Panel short term, how you can get into Google‚Äôs Knowledge Vault and then how you can build confidence.
 If you want a Knowledge Panel that accurately represents you or your company, then you need to be proactive. So, let‚Äôs get started !"
Explanation of How to Build a Multimedia Digital Content Strategy For your Company That Gets SERP Features on Google	"This is the second part of this episode about content strategy. The first part looks at what a content strategy should look like, plus the different formats of content yo√π‚Äôll want to include. Be sure to watch both.

Repurposing content. 
I love this. Making one piece of content that can then be adapted to serve multiple purposes and can be delivered in multiple formats is amazingly powerful. So when planning your content diary think very hard about how much you can move towards repurposable content.
What do I mean by repurposable? I mean content that you can release under multiple formats, on multiple platforms and potentially multiple demographics of your audience. This saves time, money and keeps your content focussed.

It's not as complex as you would think - starting with a video, you can get a surprising amount of repurposed content that is relevant and valuable to your audience. 
If you start with a piece of video content, you can create an audio file that would perhaps be a podcast, or suitable for delivery by a voice assistant. Some people prefer to listen, or perhaps someone wants to consume your content in the car. Some people prefer to read. You can transcribe your video and create an article for your blog or for your guide. I don't advise you to use the exact transcript. You need to adapt it so it is comfortable to read. The way we speak is not the same as the way we write and the way we listen is not the way that we read.  So it's important to adapt the transcript to be readable and digestible.

Making soundbites from your original video is a great way to get traction on social media. Take a funny or interesting part of your video‚Ä¶ or perhaps a great quote and push it out on your social media accounts. That is a great way to get engagement, build your audience, and help push those social accounts up onto page # of your Brand SERP too !

Both the original video, and the soundbites you make ‚Ä¶ will play into your work to get video boxes on your Brand SERP. 

Screenshots of your video can also be great as standalone content - for your site, for social media or maybe even as an image gallery‚Ä¶ and that plays into your work to get image boxes on your Brand SERP.  

If you are an international brand, you might want to make language versions. Doing subtitles for a video is simple and effective. 
In fact, you might want to subtitle even the original English version since that helps Google better understand the content video, and also helps users‚Ä¶ some people like subtitles, some people need subtitles, perhaps because they don‚Äôt speak English particularly well, or because the user is hard of hearing. For some cultures, dubbing may make the video more consumable and attractive. 

Here's a great example of repurposing.
I did an interview with John Mueller from Google, and I recorded it on video. This SERP is a mock up. It doesn't appear four times in my personal Brand SERP, but it does illustrate the opportunities repurposing presents.
There‚Äôs a clip from Twitter right at the top there. Then the blue link because - that‚Äôs the adapted transcript on my website. Then an image because I published a screenshot on my website and pushed it out onto social media. And then the original video directly on YouTube. 
So that's four different uses and four different forms of SERP pr√©sence with just one piece of content. And that's brilliant. 

In short, repurposing is a very powerful tactic - if you can use this same content in all these different formats, not only do you manage to push it out to a wider audience, but you are providing Google with content that it can use to populate multiple rich elements on your Brand SERP. 
And beyond.

Content quality. 
Make sure all the content you produce is of the quality expected by your target audience, and respects your brand image. 

You really cannot compromise on quality for written content. Take a lot of care that the style suits your audience and ensure that the vocabulary is one that your audience is comfortable with relate to. 

With audio content, the ‚Äòrules‚Äô are slightly more lax, since the spoken word is much less formal. That said, with podcasts and video, sound quality is very very important. As is making sure that accents are understandable. People will find it very difficult to listen to the end of your podcast or video if the people are difficult to understand or the sound annoys them. 
Also make sure the voices aren‚Äôt flat and monotonous. That is also very difficult to listen to.

 For video, if the audio is great quality and the voices are understandable and not monotonous, then the main bases are covered. Beyond that, the quality of the video itself depends on the audience. Think about the audience you're dealing with. If your audience expects a professional quality video, then you're going to have to make professional quality videos in a studio. But your audience may well be less demanding that you think. Don‚Äôt assume that not-so-professional image quality or surroundings is a problem. 
Think about the type of content you are producing, and the audience. On-the-fly DIY video can be very effective. Perhaps recording on a phone is acceptable. Or on the go. Or in a restaurant. Just be careful about the audio quality since bad audio makes the video every difficult to consume. 

Since video is by far the best format for repurposing, and repurposing saves a LOT of time, money and effort, not-so-professional image quality might be a compromise you can make in order to move your content strategy forwards faster and more efficiently. 
So, take a BIG step back and ask yourself ‚Äú will the video be relevant and valuable to my audience, even with not-so-professional image quality or surroundings?‚Äù 
You might be surprised :)


Images.
Because we have Photoshop we tend to think we can edit and create images ourselves. Sometimes that is fine. Just like DIY video, DIY photos and images can be absolutely fine and serve their purpose perfectly well. Like video, most audiences are quite at ease with  not-so-professional photography. Less so with graphic design. Once again, make sure the quality is sufficient for the content to be valuable to your audience.

Steady
Create a steady, consistent flow of content that is relevant and valuable to your audience. That is the secret.
Make sure that all the content you produce fits with your brand image, projects a brand personality and is engaging for your audience.
Make sure your overall content strategy projects a coherent, consistent, relevant message. 
Make sure you maintain a steady flow. Don't release vast amounts of content very quickly and then do nothing for a year. Set yourself a pace you can maintain over time - daily, weekly, monthly - and stick to it. 

A few things you really want to think about, and get right

Personality. 
By personality I don't mean comic or an extreme exuberant personality. I mean that the personality that your content projects needs to correspond to your audience and to your brand. So perhaps a gardening brand would need to project a very practical, down-to-earth personality. A medical brand would need a more professional, perhaps academic personality. A photo booth company would benefit from a very fun party-like personality.  Your content needs to project your brand‚Äôs personality.

 Try not to rely on one person within your company to provide that personality. If that person leaves the company and is replaced by someone else, then the brand personality your content projects will change. So have multiple people representing your brand through your content. At least two, perhaps three, maybe more. That way, if one person leaves, you can replace them with somebody else and there isn't an abrupt change of your brand‚Äôs personality. 

Engagement is the crux. 
Google is watching. When your content gets engagement from your audience that indicates that it is relevant and valuable. Whether it's a blog article, a video, a podcast or even an image‚Ä¶ your content needs engagement from your audience if it is to rank on your Brand SERP. Engagement can be likes, shares and comments on social media. It can be reviews on your site or on third party sites. It can be user comments. 

There's no point in creating a piece of content, putting it out there and hoping for the best. You need to promote it. You need to get your audience excited :)

Ahrefs did a piece of research showing that 90% of content on the web does not get organic traffic. It is content that has been created without thinking about the audience, and dropped on the web, hoping for the best. No strategy. No promotion. That's what most brands do. If you are doing that, stop. Now. 

Offline. 
Offline is often overlooked. But talking to real people in real life about the content you are creating is very powerful. When you meet people,at a meetup or a conference or a business meeting, tell them about the content you are creating. Give them a business card so they can visit your site, or connect with you on social - where you can then easily share your content with them. 

E-A-T
That stands for Expertise Authority and Trust. Google is looking very closely at this and it is vitally important to your SEO efforts, whether specifically for Brand SERPs or in your wider SEO strategy.
As a rule of thumb, if a piece of content does not contribute to your expertise or authority, it probably isn't a good fit for your brand content strategy.
Being an expert means publishing content that is informative and accurate. Being authoritative is all about audience engagement. 
In short, that means you need to regularly publish quality content that is appreciated by your audience. Easy.

What not to do
There is an entire episode about tactics to avoid and mistakes not to make. Please do. Watch that if you haven't done so already.

Some points specifically about content strategy.

Don't stray off topic. 
Don't release content on a random topic just because someone suggests or asks for it. Stay focused on who you are, what you do, and topics that are TRULY of interest to your target audience. That way Google has more relevant and valuable content it can potentially show in the Brand SERP. But also for your audience. You want their trust. People trust specialists more. 
Also, you want to retain their attention. So don‚Äôt throw them a curve ball.

Don't lose your voice.
 Make sure that, short and long term, every piece of content communicates with a voice and personality that appeals to your audience and  is consistent and coherent with your brand message and brand image.
That's incredibly important for your audience. If you want them to trust you, you need to maintain the same voice and the same personality that initially attracted them to you‚Ä¶ but a consistent voice is also important for Google. Maintaining a consistent voice and message will increase Google‚Äôs confidence that it has accurately understood who you are, what you do, and for whom you are likely to be suitable solution.

Visual identity
Don‚Äôt ignore, underestimate or be cheapskate on your visual identity. As you push out and produce more multimedia content, your visual identity will become as important as any other aspect of your brand identity. Visuals are faster for people to digest, and often leave a more lasting impression that words.

Inappropriate content
Don't make bad quality content under the excuse that it's throw away. On social media, particularly Twitter, a piece of content will have a very short life. It will be active for a short period of time. That doesn't mean to say it's not important. It will be seen by audience, and digested by Google even if it disappears off the radar after the first day.
And every piece of content your publish will affect their opinion of you.

But this throw away content can have an extended life. In fact you WANT it to have an extended life. 
It could go viral on the social media platform. It could get picked up by a media outlet and go viral more widely. If you have produced inappropriate content, that will haunt you. 

Lastly, content strategy is not just blog, blog, blog. 
I have had too many clients who just write blogs articles. That will no longer fly as a content strategy today. They are competing for the blue links. And those are dying out. 
And the remaining opportunities there are tough - there is so much written content out there after 20 years of the World Wide Web‚Ä¶ and many of them have the inbound links and historical success in Google that you will probably not be able to compete with.

Brands often write about things THEY find interesting.
You should be writing content that your audience will find interesting and useful. Even if that content is about you or your product, you need to make sure that you're choosing topics and the manner of expressing them that your audience will find interesting, and using vocabulary that THEY use. 
And a good starting point for finding the topics that your audience are truly interested in, and the vocabulary they use, is to look in search console. Look at the queries where you're appearing for on page three or page four, or page five and write content around that that. 

Answer their questions and address their issues in a clear manner, in the form of text, but also in the form of video, audio, or images."
Explanation of How to Build a Digital Content Strategy for SERP Features on Google	"This is a major topic, so we have split the episode into two parts. Be sure to watch both.

What is the situation here? 
The digital content you produce as a brand naturally and logically appears on your Brand SERP in one form or another. So in the context of this Brand SERP course, the content you produce as a brand is a very very important. So, this tutorial is about your digital content strategy in a wide sense - well beyond the Brand SERP.
A good, well balanced content strategy will touch every area of your digital brand ecosystem. And that is a VERY good thing since you will be projecting a consistent brand message across multiple channels. Although this course is about Brand SERPs, and the focus here is using your content strategy to fill your Brand SERP with rich elements, I‚Äôd just like to make the point that your content strategy is about building audience, and building community.

Back to Google :)
Google has always aimed to provide the best possible solution to its users. Historically, that has meant providing its users with a CHOICE of the 10 best pages in the form of blue links. Today, users want ONE SINGLE answer, in a format they are comfortable with, and as fast and efficiently as possible.
So, Google provides answers on the SERP when it can. That is fast and efficient. Increasingly the content Google is presenting on its SERPs is in a rich multimedia format. 
Google is going multimedia. And here I mean multimedia in the widest possible form. Text with images, video, audio, images). 
The content you create needs to feed that move to multimedia. 

Your content strategy is probably not particularly well adapted to this situation. Now is a good time to change that.

As a content creator, providing this content is perhaps not the easiest thing for you to do. But remember, we're trying to serve Google's users through Google, so we need to create the content that those users want. And today Google‚Äôs users want multimedia content. 
And the multimedia content you create will feed naturally into your Brand SERP. In fact, if you design your digital content strategy around gaining rich elements in your Brand SERP, that strategy will naturally create a  rich, relevant and well balanced digital ecosystem for your brand.

Before looking into the strategy, and the practical things you can do, please make sure you have watched the tutorial about How ranking works. Understanding how Google decides when and which multimedia content to show in the SERPs will help you better understand how your content strategy can ‚Äúfeed‚Äù Google and take advantage of the opportunities available, WAY beyond the traditional 10 blue links.

So, Google is going multimedia 
Its results are increasingly filled with rich elements, and that is especially true of Brand SERPs
A Brand SERP with just blue links now looks very unconvincing. Very amateur.
A Brand SERP like this one makes the brand look professional, credible and more trustworthy.

You‚Äôll notice that many of the rich elements consist of content created by the brand. THAT is what a well-managed content strategy can bring. You can get these rich elements on your Brand SERP purely with content created by third parties‚Ä¶ but that means you are relying on others, and also that you are not going to have any control.

So the question is how to create and promote content that will get you those rich elements on your Brand SERP. And make sure that the rich elements are filled with content that you create and control? 

In order to get a place on your Brand SERP a video, an image, a Knowledge Panel or other rich √©l√©ment needs to bring more value to the user searching your brand name than the blue links currently in place. 
And that means quality, relevant, useful content. It can be third party content. But it can also be content that you have created as part of your digital content strategy.

Third party content is fine as long as it is positive. But, content you have created and promoted gives you more control and more security. 

Throughout the following, bear in mind that people consume content in different ways. How a person consumes content depends on the subject matter, their environment and personal preferences. Creating content that matches the context of your users is essential.
A given subject matter may be more suited to writing, to video, images ‚Ä¶ any content about photography, images will obviously tend to dominate. Sports, perhaps video. So bear that in mind.
But it is also important to consider the environment of the person consuming your content - geo location, the device they are using, the speed of their internet connection. These will all affect the type of content that is most suitable. Finally, personal preferences also plays a role. Some people prefer to read. Some prefer visuals. Some prefer to listen. Some prefer to watch.

So a balanced digital content strategy will cover all these, with emphasis on formats that best serve the needs and desires of the target audience. 
Your content strategy will be multi-platform and multi-format. It will include most, if not all, of the following.

Blog Posts
From a Brand SERP perspective, blog posts are relatively unimportant since they appear in Brand SERPs less today than in the past. They are important in the wider content strategy since they remain the easiest format for Google to digest, the dominant format for many people and the suitable for the widest range of situations. However, for the SERPs (and Brand SERPs in particular), their effectiveness has declined significantly. Blog articles have the handicap that they are competing for a blue link. And, as Google‚Äôs SERPs become increasingly multimedia, the opportunities for them are falling. 
They do compete for featured snippets, if they are structured appropriately. But in terms of rich elements, that‚Äôs about it.

Blog Versus Guide
 I like to distinguish between a blog and a guide when with talking about content that you're writing a blog is time sensitive. It's something that's newsworthy now that probably won't be in the future. A guide-style article is something that's more long term. It's evergreen information. You write it today and it will last for many years to come.  
In both cases, clearly indicating the published date the user and to Google is vital. Fot the user that is in the page as text. For Google that is Schema.org markup like this. 
Last modified date is important too, for both users and for Google. Indicating that the news story is is up-to-date will help it rank and reassure users. For guide-style content, evergreen is not quite true. Things change and that content needs updating with the latest and freshest information. That is reassuring for users and a strong signal to Google that the content is relevant TODAY.
 So, when creating content, distinguish between a blog and a guide, and I would advise you to separate them into two different sections on your site.

Guest blog posts
You can also write for other sites. This is a great opportunity to get your brand and your message in front of a wider audience. But your guest post, or the author profile on that site, could appear on your Brand SERP. Both are possible. An author page on a strong third party site will easily rank for the name of the author. As a brand, a dedicated ‚Äúwhois‚Äù page is sometimes, but not always an option. When possible, that is a good candidate for ranking on your Brand SERP.

In terms of Brand SERPs, you would ideally guest-post several articles where your brand is the focus of the article. They will be good candidates for ranking on your Brand SERP. And they will provide corroboration for your Knowledge Graph presence. Please do watch the episode about the Knowledge Graph if you haven‚Äôt already.
But don‚Äôt bully the publisher. Even without being a candidate for your Brand SERP, then the article is an opportunity to provide some corroborating information about your brand on a third party site, rank for other terms AND get your brand in front of a wider audience. Such an article is a brand awareness opportunity both on the site itself and in the SERP - just make sure you brand name is in the meta title, the meta description AND in the content above the fold. 


Images
  Creating a visual identity that corresponds to your brand personality and message is something that's become more and more important as the web goes increasingly multimedia. In the days when the blue link truly dominated, brands were represented by a more written identity. Today, because we have so many more multimedia elements and many of them appear as images directly in the SERP, you REALLY need to have a strong visual identity. And work hard to make sure that Google represents your visual identity as accurately as possible. So once again, as you need to stay on topic and not lose your voice. Choose your brand message, choose your brand voice, choose your brand visual identity and stay consistent with them. 
A quick word about third parties‚Ä¶ your images will appear on multiple third party sites. You provide images in a media pack and that gives you some control. But people will take and share images from your site with or without permission. You‚Äôll also be placing images on your profile pages, knowledge bases such as Wikdata or Crunchbase. And you‚Äôll also be sharing images on social. 
Be careful, once an image is out on the world wide web, it can take on a life of its own and spread to many, many other sites. It is impossible to know beforehand which images will spread most widely across the web. Does it matter? Yes. If an image gets used enough around the web, it is then likely to appear on your Brand SERP in an image box. Those, let‚Äôs say ‚Äúbuzzing‚Äù images are vital. They MUST reflect your brand personality and message. Any that do not reflect positively on your brand will ruin your Brand SERP. And to a certain extent, also your wider brand image.
Photos are very powerful. They tend to rise to the top. 
Original illustrations tend to rise to the top too - PLUS original illustrations are a very good way to communicate your unique brand  personality. And an original illustration really stand out from the crowd.
Infographics had a heyday a few years ago. They saw a boon since they were seen in the SEO industry as a way of attracting links. The fact that they aren‚Äôt so popular or fashionable any more does not mean they are not useful. If an infographic is a good format for a piece of your content, and that format is appropriate for your audience, then make an infographic. 

Whether illustrations, photos, infographics, or any other image format, images are the foundation of your visual identity. And, as the web goes multimedia, your visual identity is vitally important. 
Try this. Search your brand name in Google images. Is that the brand image you want to convey ? 
Please do watch the episode about Image boxes.

Podcasts. 
Podcasts are terribly popular right now and Google is starting to put them directly in the SERP. In Brand SERPs, so far I have only seen podcasts in personal Brand SERPs of famous podcasters such as Marc Maron. I haven‚Äôt seen Google show podcasts for brands. Yet. 
I'm convinced that they will if a brand-run podcast is popular enough, and it becomes relevant and valuable to people searching that brand name. 
Include your brand name in the title if possible - that will increase the probability that it will appear on your Brand SERP.

Having a podcast indicates to Google that your brand is interacting with its environment with multimedia content, and that's a very positive signal. It‚Äôs also a great way to build your audience. As with all the content you produce, make sure it is relevant and valuable to your target audience.

Distribute your podcast through all the usual services - iTunes, Spotify, Stitcher and so on. Keep a regular rhythm of releases. Don't release them every week if you can't keep that up, a monthly podcast is fine. 


Now, video
Which platforms are best? Which should you focus on? YouTube has the strongest SEO, and is the one that is most likely to rank. But that isn‚Äôt to say it is the only one you should publish to. Publishing on Facebook, Twitter, Vimeo or even your own site is great. All and any all gain a place in the video boxes on your Brand SERP if there is enough engagement. YouTube is BY FAR the dominant platform in Brand SERPs though. 
As for format - use the one that suits your audience. Livestreaming, how-to videos, webinars, interviews‚Ä¶ even a TV-style series. Whichever you choose, be regular in terms of releases. Also remember that you don‚Äôt have to stick to one single format - you can release videos in different formats - an interview one month, a webinar the next, a roving reporter the month after. The important thing is that your brand voice is consistent and that the content is relevant and valuable to your audience.
Please do watch the episode about Video boxes."
Explanation of How to Write Great Copy For Search Engines	"Some of the content is specific to Brand SERPs, but the episode is more of a  prep course on techniques for writing in a style that makes Google‚Äôs life easier, and so is applicable to ALL the writing you do for SEO. 

Old school SEO copywriting. 
Pre-Hummingbird, pre 2015, we focussed on getting the keywords in the page‚Ä¶ lots of exact match, keyword density, perhaps some synonyms‚Ä¶ and it worked. 

But since 2015 and Hummingbird, these old-school techniques work less than less. They can still work in some circumstances, but those opportunities are fewer and fewer. 

Today, in a Hummingbird world, we're looking to create context and clarity to help Google ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù.

Now, many people say that it is not possible to optimise for the language processing algorithms of Google. I agree, you can‚Äôt optimise in the way SEOs have traditionally optimised text. But you CAN learn how to write clearly, precisely and simply. You can learn to work with context clouds, entities and relevant vocabulary.
 
What is great is that write for your audience, but tweak your style to help Google with a few techniques applied with a BIG dose of common sense.

You need to find a balance between the expectations of your audience, your brand voice and the needs of Google. 

The priorities are in THIS order 
Engaging your audience (you serve them)
Express your brand voice and message (be true to yourself or you will survive to see the long term)
Fulfill Google‚Äôs needs (Google gives free visibility to your brand, and sends you traffic ‚Ä¶ but if your copy convinces Google, but fails to convince your audience, you have wasted your efforts. 

If we approach copywriting from the perspective of optimising for SEO, then we have that list from least important to most important rather than most to least !

As a rule of thumb, the simpler to crawl, digest and understand it is, the better things are for Google. But, the easier you make it for Google, less your brand will project a unique voice, and most importantly, the less engaging it will be for your audience.

If you approach copywriting from the perspective of writing for your audience using your brand voice, but including some simple writing techniques that serve Google‚Äôs needs when it is reasonable and practical to do so, then we have a winning plan !

So, when writing content, please please please, write first and foremost for the user, in your brand‚Äôs voice and adapt to Google‚Äôs needs only when it respects the other two considerations. 

We are not optimising for Google, we are making the writing better for all three parties involved, with a clear priority of where our priorities lie.

And, because a lot of what Google needs is good copywriting, my experience is that being good to Google by applying techniques INTELLIGENTLY can improve user experience and clarify your brand voice.

Google needs context.

So what creates context? 
Firstly, relatedness. What is relatedness? It's words that are related to the subject matter. They have a relationship with the subject matter. Related words are often entities, and we'll talk about those later, but it can be any type of word - adjectives, adverbs and verbs.

Then co-occurrence, those words that often appear alongside the subject matter. For example, wave would co-occur with beach, fish, towel and boat in the context of the seaside‚Ä¶  and wave would co-occur with hand, friend, train, goodbye in the context of a separation on a railway platform.

Relatedness plus co-occurrence creates a context cloud. In this example, the words in this cloud, taken together, clearly indicate that this is a wave on the sea AND we are near or on the shore. Interestingly, if we take away the words that create the context of land, such as beach and towel, and perhaps add a few that suggest a context out at sea, such as offshore, sea bed, deep, high seas, then we have a wave out at sea.

So the combination of words will create a context cloud that makes the topic clear. In the case of ‚Äúwave‚Äù, the sea-related words remove the ambiguity of the word. That will make things much easier for Google. And if you get the balance right, you'll make it a better experience for your audience. 

The short and sharp version of what I will tell you in the next few minutes is - write clearly, be accurate, avoid confusion, keep focus, and use pertinent vocabulary to create clear context so that Google can be confident it has understand the subject matter. 

None of this should be taken to extremes if you're too simplistic, you won‚Äôt engage your audience. If you just list entities, words of co-occurrence, then your cloud becomes a concrete block and the content will make no practical sense to Google OR to your audience. You will lose credibility with both of them.
 It's a bit like keyword stuffing. Don't over do it. 

WHat to DO

‚Äúwrite for rather boring and practical 16 year old‚Äù. 
I am not being literal. Don‚Äôt write a teen novel for a medical site :)-
What I mean is keep your writing style clear for YOUR audience. And that is a good user experience.

Ambiguity 
Avoid ambiguity where reasonable. That means don‚Äôt ruin your writing style for the sake of being absolutely unambiguous. Make smart choices. If the vocabulary you use creates a great context cloud, then that naturally deals with some a ambiguity. If you have great context, a bit of ambiguity is OK.

But, for Google at least, you want to avoid utterly ambiguous references. Here's an example, ‚Äúsweet ball of fluff‚Äù. That's completely and utterly ambiguous. It means something to me. But probably not to you, and certainly not to Google. Even in the context of a sentence. 
‚ÄúMy sweet ball of fluff played with a ball of fluffy yarn‚Äù. 

Oh dear. That is so confusing in so many ways :)

If I use the words ‚Äúcat‚Äù and ‚Äúwool‚Äù, it becomes crystal clear what I'm talking about. ‚Äú My cat played with a ball of wool - what a sweet ball of fluff she is‚Äù 
That‚Äôs very clear for Google, clear AND engaging for me as a person.
So if I think my audience will react and engage with the term ‚Äúsweet ball of fluff‚Äù, I can still use the term, if I use a little bit of imagination and keep the writing engaging. 

Less syllables. 

This is something I hear a lot. It comes from the very simple Flesch‚ÄìKincaid readability tests that many tools use to analyse your texts. 

It is true that less syllables in a sentence tend to make that sentence easier to understand. So do bear the idea in mind. 

But be careful - things aren‚Äôt quite so simple. Google understands words it sees most often. Long or not. You can keep commonly used words in your copy, even if they are long. ‚ÄúOpportunity‚Äù is a long word with 5 syllables, but is very common.  And that is market by market. ‚ÄúEquilibrium‚Äù is a common word in the field of economics, but is pretty common.

Also think about accuracy here. A simple example: you might be thinking about replacing the word ‚Äúatmosphere‚Äù with the word ‚Äúair‚Äù - replacing a long word with a short one. Using air is an option. But atmosphere is a common word that Google will understand. And it is more accurate. And Air is ambiguous. Don‚Äôt lose accuracy and focus

In short, use the word that strikes a good balance between appropriateness, common usage and number of syllables.

Write shorter sentences. 

This is actually good advice for many of us who have a tendency to ramble. VERY long sentences are hard to write, and just as hard to digest‚Ä¶ And, with a few exceptions, are not good for humans any more than they are for machines.

Here‚Äôs one 
‚ÄúMy delightful, fluffy ball of fur loves to find delicious foodstuffs that she masticates when she returns home in the evening after a phenomenally strenuous day roaming the countryside and chewing the fat with local animals.‚Äù

That's long. It‚Äôs a bit of a mouthful. It's difficult to say. It's difficult to read. And it's difficult to digest and understand both for humans and particularly for Google. Not to mention the long words, the ambiguity and the colloquialisms.

And a quick word on colloquialisms, fluffy ball of fur. Chewing the fat. That kind of phrase is truly difficult. It will not be understandable for all of your audience, especially if English isn't their first language or the colloquialism is localized to a specific country, or even perhaps area of a country. 
It will certainly not be understandable for Google.
So you are losing on both fronts.

That same sentence could be shortened to ‚Äúmy cat  comes home and eats the tasty food in her bowl after a day spent outdoors with other cats‚Äù. That's VERY clear. Short, common words in a short sentence with no colloquialisms. I admit that it is a pretty boring. I'm using it as an example. 

Don't make your copy crazy boring. There's a balance between helping Google, and completely failing to engage your audience. 
Try and strike a good balance. Keep it simple for Google, but not so simple that your audience gets bored. 

As a rule of thumb, the simpler to crawl, digest and understand it is, the better things are for Google. Going back to our three priorities: your audience, you and Google (in that order :) ‚Ä¶ 
The easier you make it for Google, the less engaging it will be for your audience and the less your brand will project a unique voice.

So the question is ‚Äúhow simple can you keep this for Google whilst both FULLY engaging your audience and projecting a unique and relevant voice for your brand‚Äù. 

In terms of content, that is the dominant question.

Next, context clouds. 
What are they?
Individual words within your copy that define the overall context of the piece of content. If you pick relevant words out an put them together, in this illustration, in a cloud, with no structure, they will immediately communicate the context.

Here, the context here is very, very, very clear. Each of the words has more precise meaning when it is in a context cloud. 
If I remove it from the context cloud, it loses that preciseness of meaning - in some cases, it becomes ambiguous. And ambiguous is a problem for Google (and people for that matter :)
‚ÄúWave‚Äù could mean - a hand wave. It could be a sea wave, it could be a sound wave, it could be a light wave. 
But worse, it could be Wave, the song by Meghan Trainor, of the financial app called Wave, or even the acronym for Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool‚Ä¶
The list gets VERY long.

I found lots of other examples, too many to mention, but it's clear that just the word ‚Äúwave‚Äù without the context is ambiguous and doesn't make sense on its own. We don't understand. If I put it back in the context cloud, all of a sudden, I can understand what type of wave we are talking about.

 I mentioned preciseness of meaning‚Ä¶ WHat do I mean? An example of preciseness here would be sunglasses. That isn‚Äôt ambiguous. However the related concepts and intent of the user can change considerably with context. COntext for sunglasses could be on a beach versus in a nightclub. One is health and comfort related, the other is for fashion. The context clouds there would help Google understand what the concepts around those sunglasses are, and better match the word to the intent.

Hopefully you start to understand the scale of the problem of ambiguity, and the helpfulness of preciseness‚Ä¶  and the importance of context clouds.

So context. Cloud. How do you build one? You include relevant, related words in your copywriting that, taken together, give context and allow Google to be confident it has correctly understood what we are talking about.

Think co-occurrence. Think relatedness. If you do that, you will be able to create context clouds simply and effectively."
Explanation of How to Write for Entity-Focussed Search Engines	"Now, entities
Entities are phenomenally important in context clouds. You need to include relevant related entities in your copywriting that create context.

Entities are things, and that can be physical things such as people, places and road. They can be virtual things such as brawebsites, downloadable files, SaaS services. And it can be conceptual things such as prices and dates. 
Entities have relationships between each other. And the relationships between entities is a BIG help to Google in understanding the context of a piece of copy. 
For example, the person is lying on the towel. The towel is spread on the beach. The beach is under a sunny sky. A seagull is flying in the sky. The bird dives into the sea‚Ä¶ and so on.
There, I have indicated the relationships between entities and created a clear context very very quickly. You need to identify entities and the relationships between them within your copywriting. 

Watch the episode about Knowledge Graphs. In that episode, I explain more about how Google understands, how to help it understand, how to build its confidence in its understanding ‚Ä¶ and how to get a good idea of what Google actually knows and understands. 

In the context of copywriting, entities and relationships is absolutely vital for disambiguation, understanding and confidence in that understanding.

Ambiguity is a problem for Google everywhere, but in entities, it's especially problematic people because it relies on entities to understand the world. 

Firstly, people have ambiguous names. Lots of people share the exact same name. Brand names also share names. Multiple brands use the same name across different industries in the same country, but also brands share the same name across different countries. Brands also choose names that mean something else. ‚ÄúShell‚Äù, ‚Äú‚ÄùElf‚Äù, ‚ÄúBoots‚Äù are good examples. Ambiguity between entities is a big problem. So how can you help? 

Let‚Äôs look at a completely random example. Take the string of characters J, A, S, O, N,   B, A, R, N, A, R, D is Jason Barnard. Google can map that to the entities ‚ÄúJason Barnard‚Äù. You‚Äôll notice I said entitieS. There were 250 Jason Barnards in the world. There's me, there's a footballer, a dentist, a hockey player and, confusingly, there‚Äôs another 3internet professional‚Äù... How does Google know which one of us this string of characters is referring to? 

If the entity is surrounded by other related entities it knows, Google can figure it out easily. If the copy about Jason Barnard contains mentions of related entities Google knows such as SEMrush, Bill Slawski, John Mueller and Yoast, it is obvious that text refers to a Jason Barnard who is an internet professional.  

But which of the two internet professional Jason Barnads ? Add a r√©f√©rence to and a relationship with Boowa and Kwala, and the Barking Dogs, then there is no longer any doubt. 

Google has understood these entities. Bill Slwaski, SEMrush, John Mueller, the Barking Dogs. Boowa and Kwala, The Barking Dogs, and understands the relationship between myself and these entities. The other Jason Barnard internet professional has relationships with Bill Slwaski, SEMrush, John Mueller, but NOT with Boowa and Kwala or The Barking Dogs. 

With those mentions, it becomes crystal clear to Google, which Jason Barnard we are talking about. And the same goes for brand names, of course. 

Now, unique brand names. These are obviously much easier for Google. If a brand name is totally unique, there is no problem understanding which entity we are talking about. But TRULY unique brand names are very rare, if they exist at all. 

But even if there were a totally unique brand name, including related entities in your copy is helpful. Even if Google's understood, it wants to be super confident it has got it right. From the most ambiguous to the least ambiguous, Google LOVES to be reassured in the form of related entities. Each one it sees increases the probability that it has got the right entity. And that builds Google‚Äôs confidence ... and confidence is key.

How make we makes things even more obvious for Google and build its confidence sky-high?
Semantic triples. Semantic triples sounds complicated, but isn't. I explained this in multiple episodes, so sorry for the repetition. The knowledge graph episode has the most detailed explanation.


Semantic triples express entities with relationships‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs subject, verb, object. Entity, relationship, entity.

Here's an example. ‚ÄúSarenza sells shoes‚Äù. Easy to understand, easy to digest. Subject verb, object. Entity, relationship, entity. 

But we don't often write like that. We often do this, so ‚ÄúSarenza is a French Paris based company that sells amazingly groovy and wonderful shoes‚Äù. Here the two entities and their relationship are seperated by a lot of other words. Words that are helpful, sure‚Ä¶  But that makes it very difficult for Google to digest the semantic triple that gives it the ‚Äúentity relationship entity‚Äù sequence it is looking for. 

Now, iIf you write like this, ‚ÄúThe French Paris based company, Sarenza sells shoes that are amazingly groovy and wonderful‚Äù. The semantic triple are tight together, and that REALLY helps Google see the ‚Äúentity relationship entity‚Äù sequence and digest it. 

It goes without saying that you don't want to do this for every single sentence on every single page. And you CAN leave other words between them. Just keep the number to a minimum. Use your good judgment. Aim to write nice, compact semantic triples when understanding the entities and the relationship between them will really help nail that context for Google.

But if you can get into the habit of doing this, you will change your writing style only slightly, and you will find that your writing becomes easier to consume for both for your audience and for Google.

Choose your verbs widely wisely. For a semantic triple to work well for Google, the verb needs to be unambiguous and clear. 
I did some tests and here's an example. ‚ÄúJason Barnard plays the double bass‚Äù is a very, very clear semantic triple. We have Jason Barnard the entity, double bass the entity and the relationship is ‚Äúplays‚Äù.
Google will understand that this is relevant for the query ‚Äúwho plays the double bass?‚Äù. 

But, if I use the verb funkslaps -  ‚ÄúJason Barnard funkslaps the double bass‚Äù, I haven't indicated the relationship clearly. Google doesn't understand that funkslapping is a style of playing the double bass. Google will NOT understand that this is relevant for the query ‚Äúwho plays the double bass?‚Äù.  Google is moving forwards fast, but doesn‚Äôt yet understand this kind of subtlety. 
So, for the moment at least, keep those verbs clear.

Vocabulary. 
I have left this to last because this your source of related entities, words and words of co-occurrence the relatedness and co-occurrence.
It is what will bring all this close to your audience and keep them engaged, whilst also pleasing Google :)
 It is absolutely essential that you write using the vocabulary your audience uses. 

First thing is to build your lexicon.
Great ways to find that vocabulary 
Look in search console and export every keyword that you appear for. In the browser based version of search console, you get a thousand search queries. But you can get many more than that quite easily. If you segment your site by folder using the ‚Äúpages filter‚Äù - just include pages that contain the folder name. Do that for each folder, and you‚Äôll have a nice big list of queries. You can filter on popular single words and filter with queries that contain that specific word. That's a really good way to get many, many, many more than a thousand keywords out of search console. 
More specifically, if you have existing content that you are improving, then isolate that page to get relevant vocabulary specific to that content.

Another great trick is to ask customer-facing people in your company - the sales force, the after sales team, the social media people, perhaps...  the people who are actually talking to your customers. Ask them what your customers are saying, what they are asking, what vocabulary they use. 

Another great idea is to look at your reviews. See what vocabulary your customers are using when they review your company and your products.

It is a little harder to identify the truly relevant words in keyword tracker tools such as SEMrush or Woorank since the only context you can create in them is the competitor or the market ‚Ä¶ and the words you find might not appeal to YOUR specific target audience. So be a little bit careful there.

With those techniques, you can build a pretty impressive lexicon that will be VERY relevant to your audience.

Conclusion
The art of writing is ‚ÄúEngaging Marries Understanding‚Äù. To get that balance that is right for your audience, right for you and good enough for Google, you need to be smart and creative. I think that‚Äôs a pretty interesting challenge.

What not to do. 
For this topic, there isn‚Äôt much relevant advice in the episode tactics to avoid mistakes. But still do make sure you‚Äôve watched it !
Here are some specific Not-To‚Äôs for copywriting.

Don't stuff. Don‚Äôt add bucketloads of related entities, words and words of co-occurrence. Your lovely fluffy context cloud will become a concrete block of context and lose its effectiveness. 
This is a bit like keyword stuffing. But bear in mind that Google is much, much smarter today than it was in the days when keyword stuffing was a successful tactic. 

Don't over-simplify. 
If you over-simplify your texts, you'll end up talking down to your audience and you will lose credibility. 

Don't underestimate the effort. 
Mastering this new style will take time. Don‚Äôt get impatient. Work at it until you get it right,

Don't underestimate the effectiveness
Unlike some other techniques, the results of this are ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù and the results are not always direct. They won‚Äôt often be visible. But the techniques ARE effective. This example of ‚Äúplays the double bass‚Äù was greatly encouraging for me."
Explanation of Why Your Brand SERP is The Most Important Aspect of Your Digital Marketing STrategy	"The situation
Think about when you walk into a party. First impressions really do count. Those first few seconds are crucial. A positive or negative opinion is formed in their minds, and changing that first impression is difficult. So you have to get it right if you want to keep the path to conversion as frictionless as possible. Obviously, that is great for your bottom line. Shorter path to conversion, higher conversion rates, better client retention‚Ä¶

And remember, whoever the person is, this is a critical stage of their relationship with you - they are navigating to your site or researching you... and you really want to keep them 100% focussed on you and the solutions you can bring to them.

Brands pay a lot of attention to how they look on most platforms. They spend a great deal of time and resources on their website that every page, ever piece of text, every image is pixel and letter perfect. They‚Äôll spend time and ressources making sure that their printed matrial is perfect for prospects and clients. That every word, every image carries meaning, and that their brand message is communicated in the manner THEY want. 
A Brand SERP deserves the same time,  care and attention since at some stage in their relationship with your brand, they will see your Brand SERP, and that Brand SERP carries a message, just like all the other branded materials I mentioned. Plus, it caries the implicit stamp of authenticity and believability that Google brings.


International
Brand SERPs vary ENORMOUSLY from country to country.
Ideally, use a tracking tool that is both neutral and can track multiple countries regions or towns. Geo-location affects the makeup of Brand SERPs a LOT, and if you do the searches by hand yourself, you‚Äôll miss some opportunities.



What is the driving force behind Google putting content on your Brand SERP?
Relevance and value. 
What people see on your Brand SERP is what Google thinks is most relevant and brings most value to someone searching your brand name.
That is a theme that runs right through this course.
And single most important idea.

If there is something on your Brand SERP that you don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúshould‚Äù be there as yourself WHY Google feels it is relevant and valuable to people searching your brand name. If it is neutral or negative, then remember that Google feels it is relevant for people need to know that aspect. To remove that content from your Brand SERP you need to create or promote content that deserves to leapfrog it‚Ä¶ content that is MORE relevant and MORE valuable to people searching your brand.
If the content is innaccurate - correct it yourself if you can, or have it corrected by the site owner. If that isn‚Äôt possible, same as before (and I‚Äôll repeat myself here) create or promote content that deserves to leapfrog it‚Ä¶ content that is MORE relevant and MORE valuable to people searching your brand.

What makes content relevant and valuable
One powerful signal to Google that a piece of content is relevant and valuable to your audience is engagement. Unfortunately, engagement is not simple to measure, and diff√©rente types of content have diff√©rente engagement metrics, and diff√©rente demographics engage with content differently‚Ä¶ but bear in mind throughout this course, and when you are working on improving your Brand SERP that engagement is key. It will always be very difficult to rank a piece of content that has little engagement relative to other content competing for page #1 
When your Brand SERP looks great then not only does that indicate that you have a great reputation in Google‚Äôs eyes, but also that If the Brand SERP looks great, then everything is going well, and the world is all roses. 
Brand SERPs hit right at the core of your business, and also right at the core of Google‚Äôs opinion of you. That is why these courses are so important for every brand. 

Further, many existing clients navigate to your site this way. WHat do THEY see? What do THEY think? 
Does it matter what they see? After all, they are just navigating to your site. Yes, It DOES matter. Seeing this every day will chip away at their respect for you little by little. What happens when they decide to do some research on a competitor, and that competitor has a great SERP like this?
Not only clients and prospects people researching your brand will Google you. And that journalist you met at that conference who you spent hours charming and a small fortune buying drinks will Google your brand when they get back to the office. Or the person you didn‚Äôt talk to who saw your brilliant talk with amazinf graphics and Powerpoint animations will Google your brand when they get back to the office, undoing a lot of your hard work. Or the prospect you wined and dined over lunch who went home and Google your brand when they got back to the office. That could undo all your hard work. Or the top-rated Machine Learning engineer who you are trying to head hunt from Google‚Ä¶
WHat do they think? Has that page helped your chances of closing the deal?


People are searching your Brand SERP. perhaps more than you think
 Worldwide, At least 1 search in 6 contains a brand name!

Have a guess at how many searches there are on your brand name, then go and have a look in Google Search Console.
Screencast 
Were you right ?  Were you even close?
Probably not

Who is searching your brand name?
clients
prospects
potential hires
partners
suppliers
distributors
investors
...
 you name it, if you are doing business with someone, they will Google your brand nama at some point.


Why are Brand SERPs so important?
Look at that list of people searching your brand name. They are ALL vital to your business. What they see influences how they perceive your brand. And also how they will approach your brand when they interact with you.
Just like when you walk into a room - the at-a-glance impression is vital and affects your relationship moving forward.

What appears on page #1 when someone Googles your brand name is therefore vital.

And that is the main message and the main focus of this course
It is up to you to make sure that what Google shows on YOUR Brand SERP is positive, impressive, convincing, accurate, 
COntent you have created and promoted gives you more control and more security. 

Demographics
That list of people, and their relative importance to your business depends on your industry, your business model, the maturity of your business and many other factors.
clients
prospects
job seekers
partners
suppliers
distributors
investors
‚Ä¶


But it is a great idea to think carefully about WHO are the most important. Your Brand SERP will not vary very much from person to person within a geo-location, so you need to create the Brand SERP that best serves your most important audience

Looking to control what people see when they search your brand name and don't forget it, potential clients, but it's also your existing clients. Keeping them on board is just as important, if not more so than creating the new client base and the bottom half. 

Google‚Äôs opinion (of the world‚Äôs opinion of you)
Better still, what Google shows in your Brand SERPs is a reflection of its opinion of the world‚Äôs opinion of you. So if it is showing these ace reviews, and not the less-good ones, then Google feels positively about your credibility and is happy to communicate that confidence to its users via your Brand SERP.


When you check your Brand SERP manually‚Ä¶. Be wary !

It is NOT what everyone sees.

Brand SERPs are amongst the most volatile - they change enormously according to circumlstance. More than almost any other SERP.

Location : this changes a good 70% of most Brand SERPs
From the obvious ANATOMY (ie type of results), to the  actual results - something you‚Äôll see straight away when you look at your Brand SERP in diff√©rente countries.

But less obvious is the links in rich sitelinks, the videos in your video boxes, to the Knowledge Panel - all of these potentially change drastically according to location‚Ä¶.

But then device, search history‚Ä¶ and language mixups (English person searching in france, for example) also affect 

That makes for a very variable set of results depending on location, device, person, language settings. What you see is not what THEY get :)


what your audience finds  important pertinent and valuable
IMO Google is a better judge of that than you or I are :)
Brand SERPs are a reflection of what Google thinks you audience finds valuable‚Ä¶ and that is 



This is Google‚Äôs game
The people Googling your brand name are Google‚Äôs users, on Google‚Äôs website, so Google sets the rules of the game. It's Google's gamer 100% right down the line. You don't get to choose. If your audience uses Google, as far as your Brand SERP is concerned, you HAVE no choice to play Google's game by Google‚Äôs rules. 



Your brand is your biggest asset
Remember also that your brand is precious. Your brand is an entity. Google understands that your brand is a thing. Your brand is the thing. It's what Google understands and it's what Google will be looking at. It doesn't look at your website. Your website is simply a representation of your brand. It's your brand that holds all the value, not the website. Now, that wasn't true 10 years ago. But it is true for most brands today, and it will be true for all brands in the future.
It has always been the case that, faced with your audience, your brand is the most valuable asset. That is now also true with Google."
What to Expect From Jason Barnard's Brand SERP Course	"What to Expect From These Brand SERP courses

Everyone who is important to your business will Google your brand name sooner or later. What they see is called a Brand SERP - it‚Äôs your new business card - you could even say your new homepage - and you want it to look as good as possible. Positive, accurate and - dare I say it - sexy

Kalicube‚Äôs courses give you all the techniques you need to seize control of your Brand SERP and make sure everything Google shows your audience is positive, and that the anatomy of that SERP clearly communicates your brand message.

This course is perfect for any brand that wants to look good when their audience Googles their brand name. From multinational corporations to national brands, right through to local bricks and mortar businesses. 

And if you think that's quite a broad spectrum, it is... but that's why we broke this down into multiple courses. Different types of company need to manage different aspects of Brand SERPs. For example, a local business needs to deal with the Google My Business Panel, a national or international brand needs to deal with the Knowledge Panel. 
And priorities differ - you may be happy with simply making your Brand SERP positive and accurate. Or you may be more ambitious and want to multiple rich elements on your Brand SERP, 

Brand SERPs are surprisingly rich and complex beasts - these multiple short courses allow you to pick and choose the aspects that are relevant for your business and your strategy. That means you won‚Äôt be sitting through lessons that are not relevant to you and you won‚Äôt be paying for information you don‚Äôt need.

I'll be your tutor for every lesson in every course in this series.
I've been working on optimising sites for Google since 1998, and I‚Äôve been studying what Google shows for exact match brand searches since 2013. 

Today, I have a lot of data to analyse... Kalicube currently tracks over 20,000 brands across six different countries, so I have a phenomenal number of examples from around the world, and a seriously large amount of information to examine... currently around 10 million results. 

That means I have a deep understanding of how brands SERPs work and have a lot of techniques that will help you to improve yours. 

Speaking of which, please do add your brand name to the Kalicube tracking system here. It's free whether you sign up for the course or not - and for me, the more brands Kalicube tracks, the more information I have, and the better these courses will become.

I really love Brand SERPs. Studying them has taught me an awful LOT. Interestingly, the insights I've gained from working on Brand SERPs have helped me enormously with my understanding of a wider SEO strategy. And I‚Äôm absolutely sure that you‚Äôll find the same is true for you, whether you have previous experience in SEO or not.  

Start with the fundamentals
Every brand needs to deal with improving the results that currently appear - that's covered by the fundamentals course - and most brands will want to remove suboptimal results from their SERP - that's also covered by a dedicated course.

Beyond those two courses the rest are organised by type of business so you can pick and choose the exact combination that suits your needs.

The courses be updated regularly with new content
As you probably know, Google changes its algorithm frequently and adds new features on a regular basis. I‚Äôll update each course in this series when the situation changes for Brand SERPs - So you know that you‚Äôll always be up to date with the latest techniques for YOUR Brand SERP. 

Lastly, the nitty gritty
Each course contains between 6 and 12 lessons. Each lesson contains a video that lasts between 10 and 30 minutes. So that‚Äôs 2 to 3 hours of video tutorials per course. In each video I explain one aspect of the Brand SERP, and provide specific tactics you can use to improve your Brand SERP. From quick and easy tasks such as improving how your homepage looks on the SERP to more adventurous tasks such as how to get and manage a Knowledge Panel, or how to get Twitter boxes like these‚Ä¶ 

In between, there are techniques for removing negative results from your SERP, to saving money on Google Ads - and if you run branded Google Ads, the savings you will make thanks to that lesson alone will justify the cost of the course.

Most lessons include supplementary material, sometimes quite a lot. Depending on the type of lesson, the extras vary from warnings about mistakes to avoid, to technical code you can implement to templates for content‚Ä¶. And many more in between."
Explanation of Jason Barnard's Life and How He Became The Brand SERP Guy	"I‚Äôm Jason Barnard, the Brand SERP Guy, and I‚Äôm your tutor. 
This will be a short 5 minute video, just to let you know a little bit about me and then how I learned everything that you can learn in this course.

In the mid nineteen eighties I went to university in Liverpool and graduated in Economics with a specialisation in statistical analysis. 

I then moved to Paris, worked briefly as a teacher, then made a living playing double bass with a folk-punk band called The Barking Dogs. That lasted 8 years... and then the band split‚Ä¶ 

Here‚Äôs how I got into SEO. 
I launched my first site in 1998, which is the same year Google was incorporated. 
So I‚Äôve been optimising content for Google since the very beginning and we kind of grew up together (but Google hasn‚Äôt noticed :)

That first website was UpToTen and I grew it to 5 million visits a month. Over 20% of those visits were organic from Google. That‚Äôs more than a million visits a month just from Google for a site for kids aged up to ten years old. 

Now, here‚Äôs how I got into Brand SERPs.
In 2013, I got curious to see if I could control what Google shows when someone types a name. Like all good scientists I started experimenting on myself. 

Initially, my personal Brand SERP was a simple list of blue links, and it contained references to a mixture of some of the 250 Jason Barnard‚Äôs around the world - principally me, a footballer, a dentist and a podcaster. 

Step 1 of the experiment was to make all references to me positive and accurate. That was reasonably easy, but threw up some interesting tricks. 

Step 2 was to really dominate page 1 so that I owned the SERP. I had to use quite a few of the SEO tips and tricks I learned over the previous 15 years. Plus I learned some new ones along the way. 

Step 3 was triggering SERP features - but I call them rich elements. I‚Äôve triggered and optimised quite a few for my own SERP - a Knowledge Panel, Twitter boxes, video boxes, image boxes, related searches‚Ä¶ 
And today the SERP now looks sexy and convincing.

Now that experiment got me quite a few clients - companies who want their Brand SERPs to look as positive, accurate and convincing as mine. 
That corporate work has allowed me to expand my skillset and learn to trigger and optimise more rich elements and it also taught me to deal with negative results such as bad articles, bad reviews and vitriolic forums.

In 2019, I decided to make this course and teach other marketers to master Brand SERPs :)
Have fun with the course :)"
An Overview of What You Can Do to Improve Your Brand SERP	"In this course we will focus on the things that are easier for you to optimise and look mainly at the results that are already on page 1.

If you know about meta titles, meta descriptions, the head section in html and search console you will find that you can skip parts wich as the screencasts, and parts of the explanations. Feel free to fast forward over those. 
You'll breeze through this initial fundamentals course and have your brand serp looking much better in a few hours. 
You can do the lessons in any order.

If you don't know those things, don‚Äôt worry. Nothing in here is very difficult or technical so you‚Äôll be able to do all of it.

The first thing to do is start with the glossary of terms lesson. Then do the others in order.
If go through the course and follow my advice carefully and thoroughly you'll have your brand serp looking much better in a day or two.

One exception - if you have a branded search terms campaign on Google Ads, then you might want to watch the Google Ads Lesson and optimise your campaigns straight away since that will save you money directly.

Each lesson will go through a particular aspect of Brand SERPs. I‚Äôll tell you what the situation is, and what you can do to optimise that aspect of YOUR Brand SERP. 

Most lessons also have some accompanying What Not To Do content - either video or an article. 
Please do take the time to look at that so as not to make avoidable mistakes.

Now, a quick reminder about who you are doing this for, why it will help your bottom line.

Many people who are impoortant to your business will Google your brand name to find you, or find out more about you. 
Google is your business card and your homepage. 
Most people see THIS homepage, THIS representation of your brand before they see YOURS. That beautifully homepage you spend countless hours (and dollars) perfecting isn't the first thing they see. 

A better Brand SERP makes sure they have a positive first impression about you and that helps your bottom line.

For prospects that means a shorter path to conversion, higher conversion rates, better client retention‚Ä¶

For existing clients that means better client engagement, less churn, easier upsells‚Ä¶

And then there are indirect effects on your bottom line through the positive effect it has on all the other people who are important to your business - potential hires, journalists, partners, investors‚Ä¶

Conclusion - You owe it to your bottom line to sexy it up.

Here‚Äôs my mantra : A good Brand SERP is good for your bottom line. A great Brand SERP is great for your bottom line.

A SERP like this is a great Google Homepage to have and this series of courses explains exactly how to do that.
The foundation course is the basics that will allow most brands to make their SERP more attractive, positive and accurate.
Probably something like this.

The other courses build on that foundation and take specific aspects further to help any brand make their SERP really positive, reflective of their brand message and incredibly convincing, even at a glance, like these (show a few). 

One might even say ‚Äòsexy‚Äô, like these  (show a few).

Now, let‚Äôs get down to work.

Before you start the lessons in this course, let‚Äôs look at YOUR Brand SERP and set out where the starting line is.
We need to check and make a record of your Brand SERP both on desktop and on mobile, check them in all the countries where you have an audience that is important to your business, and identify what shows above the fold (what people see when the Brand SERP first displays in their browser) and below the fold (what they see when they scroll).

Over to the screencast.

Great. You‚Äôre ready to get started.

Now we are going to start changing those SERPs and making them look better."
Explanation of the Simple Techniques You Can Use to Improve Your Website Homepage for Brand SERP Optimisation	"Obviously, you want to get a quick start improving your SERP, making it look as good as you possibly can. Let‚Äôs start at the top of the SERP with a result that you control.

Your homepage almost certainly appears right at the top of your Brand SERP, whether you tried to make that happen or not. That is because it is the most appropriate and relevant result for your brand name. 

This might not be the case if you have an ambiguous brand names - for example, a brand name that is also a common word or phrase, or a name shared with another brand (‚ÄúYellow Door‚Äù, fits both these examples). Managing Brand SERPs for ambiguous brand names is tricky. This course will help, but doesn‚Äôt cover all the aspects specific to such ambiguity.

So, assuming your homepage appears right at the top of the organic results, then pretty much everyone who Googles your name will see it. And keep in mind who those people are‚Ä¶ clients, prospects, potential hires, partners, suppliers, distributors, investors - in short, people who either do business with you, or are thinking about doing business with you. People who are vitally important to your business and your bottom line.

It‚Äôs vital that the message right at the top of your Brand SERP projects a clear, accurate and convincing message.  

Most brands imagine that their homepage is perfectly well optimised. It often isn‚Äôt, especially in the context of a Brand SERP. Let‚Äôs look at what you should do.

The meta title
The first thing you need to look at is the meta title. This is something that people naturally look at. Most people at least skim-read your meta title, so it needs to be perfect. To the letter.

There isn‚Äôt much space. Between 60 and 70 characters. The actual number depends on the letters you use. That might seem strange but it is logical. To keep things neat on the SERP, Google allocates a specific space to the meta title - it calculates the pixel width of the characters with a limit of 512 pixels. Anything over this limit is cut off and replaced by an ellipsis.
On Mobile, that limit is longer since the title wraps onto two, sometimes three lines like this. 

Why didn‚Äôt I show a Brand SERP result there for mobile? Because on Brand SERPs on mobile, Google usually only shows the brand name, like this. So optimising for that 512 pixel limit on desktop is a good approach. Just be aware that people on mobile will often just see your brand name in the meta title.

What does the title need to say?
Describe your brand, your global offer. If you can, get your unique selling point in there. But don‚Äôt put too much information or you‚Äôll overwhelm the reader. Make sure the message your meta title projects is positive, clear and convincing‚Ä¶ oh, and you make sure you've got your brand name in there because that's what people are searching for. 

Most brands put the brand name at the start or the end. For Brand SERPs, I suggest the adding it at start because in the context of Brand SERPs, that is what your audience are looking for. Ideally, don‚Äôt weave it into your text, since that makes it difficult for Google on mobile. My little experiment shows that when I put ‚ÄúKalicube‚Äù at the start, Google gets it fine. When I put ‚ÄúKalicube‚Äù in the middle, it shows ‚ÄúKalicube.pro‚Äù.

Lastly, if possible use at least one word that resonates with your audience emotionally. For Kalicube, I have just used the word ‚Äúyou‚Äù, which necessarily resonates with people. 

I could push that further and be more overtly marketing and use ‚ÄúKalicube - Making your Brand SERP work for you‚Äù. Which tone you choose is really a question of conforming to the  brand message you want to project.

Meta titles like these read really well. They impress your prospects and reassure your clients.

Next, the meta-description. 
Make sure you put a meta description in your homepage. You'd be surprised how many sites don't have one. If you don't provide a description, Google will pick the text IT thinks is most appropriate from the page‚Ä¶ and that rarely looks great. Like this example. Not very convincing. You want to control what Google shows as much as you possibly can. If you don't put them at a description, you are leaving to luck what Google shows there right at the top. 
Also, make sure it is long enough. If it is too short, Google will ignore it and choose another from your content. How short is too short in clear. anything less than 100 characters is never going to convince your audience, so let‚Äôs set that as the strict minimum.

Like your homepage meta title, your homepage meta description should contain your brand name, otherwise Google will often choose another text from the page, and you lose that control. The description should expand on the message you projected in the meta title. Say a little bit more about your overall offer, give your Unique Selling Point, and add some copy that will convince - or re-convince - people that your brand is the best solution for them. 

Remember the people looking at your Brand SERP are either already doing business with you, or are thinking about it, potentially on the cusp of making the decision. So you need to project a message that confirms to them that they are happy doing business with you or that they will be happy doing business with you.

An example would be ‚ÄúWhat someone sees when they Google your brand is vital to your business. It's called a Brand SERP. Kalicube helps you leverage your Brand SERP to improve your bottom line. Find out more >>‚Äù

Here‚Äôs what I did  with this description - attracted curiosity, indicated it is important, added a reason to keep reading, got them thinking, clarified what I am talking about, indicated that I can help them make money, and finally invited them in.

if you have really good reviews, you might want to add that to the meta description since peer group confirmation is a very strong emotional stimulus that helps reassure clients and potential clients. And for anyone Googling your brand name, be they clients, prospects, potential hires, partners, suppliers, distributors, investors‚Ä¶ or whoever‚Ä¶ a great review score from an independent, trusted source is a great way to reinforce your credibility.

I know of several well-known brands that do this, and they tell me it works very well.

With that meta title and meta description, I have covered both desktop and mobile, and I hope I have prospects with an explanation and a little coaxing whilst also reassuring existing clients that they chose the right brand as a partner. A good balance. 

Next, content. 
You might want to tweak the content of your homepage, bearing in mind that people who are landing on this page from Google can be broken down into three groups

1 - People who are already doing business with you and are looking for a specific part of your site, so you need to make navigation as easy as possible for them. 
2 - people who are thinking about doing business with you, in which case you need to make sure that they understand that you are the right solution
3 - People who have searched other terms that your homepage ranks for

Have a look in search console and see how this breaks down. Groups 1 and 2 might well be the majority. Perhaps even the vast majority. In which case the page needs to be REALLY brand focussed.

Have a look at your homepage and see if those two messages are sufficiently well addressed.

If group 3 is a significant proportion of Google traffic to your homepage, then the message needs to address those people too. This is likely to be a tricky balancing act. 

Whether addressing two or three audience personas, this homepage balancing act is a tricky combination to get right, but absolutely essential - it hits right at the core of your business.

Specifically from a Brand SERP perspective, throughout the content on your homepage, be sure to adequately address the needs of your existing clients and people who are there because they are thinking about doing business with you. Those are the people who are fundamentally important to your business TODAY.

Above the fold

Take extra care with what's above the fold. This is what people see when they land on your homepage. It‚Äôs a visual image that sticks in people‚Äôs minds. This is the first impression for new visitors and the lasting impression your existing clients retain since they see it so often. 

Obviously the title on the page is really important but the overall design is arguably more so. The overall impact of that first view is what really sticks in people‚Äôs minds.

Taking it a little further, the navigation needs to be intuitive. 
As I mentioned, above the fold, your homepage needs to read great, look convincing so that people stick around. But then where do they go next? 
You need to make it REALLY easy for the user to understand ‚Äòwhat to do next‚Äô - the homepage is very very rarely the first and last step in a user journey on your site. Users visiting your homepage are always on their way somewhere else. That‚Äôs a lovely, and helpful concept to bear in mind.

And take into consideration that what people see above the fold on desktop is VERY different to what they will see on mobile. Mobile is space-poor and the design is necessarily different. What they see is VERY different. 

Below the fold
Below the fold is SLIGHTLY less important  - it‚Äôs what they see when they scroll down the page, which many people will, especially on mobile. The impression on their minds is less strong than above the fold, but still merits a lot of attention. 

So check both above and below the fold, on both desktop and mobile. Optimise them all.

Importantly, adapting the content won't make any difference either to your ranking on your Brand SERP (you are already number #1) or to what Google shows someone searching your brand name (you already optimised your metas).

Next, you also want to add links to the about us and contact us pages so that they're easily found  by both users and Google. People like to see that they can find out more about you and contact easily, even if they don‚Äôt necessarily visit those pages. 

Easy access to these pages is also incredibly important for your credibility in the eyes of Google. There's no need to make them big and terribly in your face. They just need to be easy to find. Typical places to put them would be in the footer or the header menu.

Favicon
Make sure you have the code in your site for the favicon. On mobile, the favicon appears next to your result like this. Looks great. 

On desktop, Google keeps experimenting at the time you're listening watching this lesson it might or might not appear. But either way it is worth adding, just for mobile.

Make sure you have a great quality, attractive image in the page. On mobile, Google shows images for most results when it can. For a homepage ranked #1 on the Brand SERP, it tends not to. But sometimes does. So worth getting this right because these images really make an impact on the SERP.

 If you indicate to Google which image on the page to use, either using schema markup like this‚Ä¶
or og metas like this...
Google will usually use it. If you don‚Äôt explicitly indicate an image, Google will either show no image - which is a pity - or show the first large image it finds in the page.

Note that when you change the image you are asking Google to use, if the replacement image is an image Google has never seen before, then the image that WAS on your Brand SERP will probably disappear and won‚Äôt be replaced by the new image immediately. Wait a few days. If the new image still doesn‚Äôt appear, double check your code.

When all that is done, and you are satisfied you have done it all really well, you can ask Google to reindex it. Just submit the page through search console.

My sites take less than a minute to update and go live on Google. That is pretty fast. Yours might be slower. Could be a few minutes, could be a few hours. After a day, if it hasn‚Äôt updated, then double check the actual page to make 100% sure IT was updated. If your homepage is the latest groovy version we just created, you submitted correctly to Search Console  and Google hasn‚Äôt updated after a day, then you might want to get an expert in to have a look for possible reasons.

Also be aware that the first time you submit is the fastest. After the first, it gets slower. That slow-down in reactivity-to-live  is a good reason to check, double check and triple check everything you changed on your homepage BEFORE submitting the first time. It will make this first lesson MUCH more satisfying for you :) 

Over to the screencast.

My experience is that the faster the turnaround from Search Console submission to live update, the more Google trusts your brand. That is obviously a good thing for your Brand SERP work, and also your overall SEO strategy."
Explanation of the Simple Techniques You Can Use to Improve Your Website to Get Rich Sitelinks for Brand SERP Optimisation	"I gave you a quick introduction to rich sitelinks in the Homepage Lesson. Here I will tell you how to trigger them if you don't have them and optimise them if you do

Here are 5 reasons you want them
1 - They are above the fold, top front and center, so they are seen by everyone. They are very, very visible and very, very important on Brand SERPs. 
2 - they take up a lot of real estate where you control the content. 
3- they help your audience since sitelinks allow them to navigate straight to the page or section they want. That‚Äôs a good, positive user experience
4 - a brand that has only normal sitelinks like this, or worse, none atall  looks really unprofessional and unconvincing.
5 - they often kill a blue link, leaving less results on page 1 - and that means less for you to worry about

They are quite easy to trigger and yet only about 50% of brands have them on their Brand SERP. SO you really should be aiming to have them on your Brand SERP

Here are some examples. They look pretty good and take up a lot of space. 

This one in particular looks great - it is really helpful to users searching the brand name and those 10 links with descriptions take up an impressive amount of real estate that the brand controls. 

A SERP result with rich sitelinks contains about 100 words on desktop which is significantly better than the 25 or so you get with just the homepage meta title and description. That is an amazing opportunity to expand your brand message and convince right there on the Brand SERP. 

On mobile, you get about 15 extra words. Not quite as much as on desktop, but still worth having :)

Here‚Äôs a couple of examples on mobile. Less impressive, but still very helpful and useful on your Brand SERP. 

And Google is making rich sitelinks even richer. 
Here are a couple of examples on mobile. On the left you see thumbnails with links to videos. On the right, images with links to the latest news. 

These site links are looking pretty groovy. Google is showing them because these two brands have incredibly rich content strategies, and that content is very relevant to their audience, Google considers that this presentation brings value to users searching those brand names. 

Right now, few brands get anything more than the more traditional examples I showed before‚Ä¶. But with a very rich content strategy, smaller brands could potentially aspire to results like these. 
Google is getting more adventurous with rich sitelinks as time goes by. They are obviously useful to users, and a great way for Google to show a variety of deeper content that allow its users to navigate quickly to the part of the site they want to visit. So these rich sitelinks are fundamentally important to your Brand SERP strategy. 

What you don't want is something like this.
Several things here. 
One. It looks very unprofessional. 
Two. The brand has missed an opportunity to kill a blue link, and reduce the number of results it needs to optimise. Remember, the less results on the Brand SERP, the less there is to optimise and the less risk anything less-than-perfect appears. 
Three. They are wasting a great opportunity to project a more detailed and controlled brand message‚Ä¶ front and center, right at the top.  
And this is even worse. No site links at all. There is no excuse for having no site links. 
If you are in a situation where you have no rich sitelinks or no sitelinks atall, then you are probably losing traffic to the results below, especially if they are not results that link to sites you control. In that case, Google Ads is a temporary solution you could use. If nobody else is bidding on your brand name, then the cost will be low - a few cents per click, and probably remain profitable for you. If your competitors are bidding on your brand name then you probably should be using Google Ads to reduce the leakage.
Watch the Google Ads lesson for more on that.

Now, What to do.
What are the pages that typically show as rich sitelinks? 
Google chooses pages that it feels users might want to access directly. Pages that are helpful and relevant to the user who just Googled your brand name. Obviously there is great variety, but here are some of the main candidates.

Most of these pages are unimportant within your wider SEO strategy. Many brands don‚Äôt do any optimisation on them at all. But in the context of your Brand SERP, they take on enormous importance and are well worth optimising for that.


Which pages will show?
In the context of Brand SERPs, Google is using the rich sitelinks to improve the user experience of ITS user. The aim is to allow the user to navigate directly to the part of your site that they want to visit, rather than going through your homepage, and then your navigation system, which is potentially a bad user experience.

So, Google chooses between 4 and 10 pages that it feels are most relevant and useful to the user according to their context. That context consists of many factors, including the geo-location of the user, their search history, the type of device, and historical data from the pool of searches on your brand name.

Some examples of context - on mobile, Google might choose a page specifically for downloading a mobile App, whereas it wouldn‚Äôt for desktop. 
If the user is geo-located near a specific outlet, Google might choose the page that presents that shop. If the user searches the brand name very regularly, Google might be more inclined to show the login and client support pages.   

So bear in mind that you need to have a variety of pages that Google can use to cover as many user-specific contexts as possible.

Influencing which sitelinks appear.
Unfortunately, you have no direct control. All you can do is influence it - encourage Google to show the pages you prefer. The following tips and tricks will help ensure that most of the links that show are those you prefer, but you will never be 100% successful since Google shows those that it thinks is relevant and useful to the user in their specific context. 

Optimisation techniques
For any pages that have a specific type in Schema.org, such as AboutPage, ContactPage, ItemPage, ProfilePage‚Ä¶ add that markup, and that will help them to appear more regularly. It doesn't guarantee that they will appear more regularly, but it reinforces Google‚Äôs understanding by indicating explicitly the role each of those pages plays. 

That will encourage Google to show them as sitelinks more often, and that will help enormously with the stability of the site links and the predictability of what will appear when somebody searches your brand name. 

A second trick is siloing. When content is logically organised in vertical silos, or in folders, it is easier for Google to deal with. Many of the best candidates for sitelinks are pages that can be grouped together in a silo of folder called ‚Äòour company‚Äô. 
Do that. Put pages such as About Us, Contact Us, C level employee profile pages, careers and so on in a folder together ‚Äò/company/‚Äô. 
You also want to group pages for existing clients in a similar manner. 

Pages that are only used in sitelinks
Some of the pages that appear as sitelinks in Brand SERPs, such as Login, Contact Us, or About Us, are not used in your wider SEO strategy and so usually don‚Äôt appear in other SERPs for other keywords. You can focus on making those pages perfect for their role as sitelinks on your Brand SERP.

For other pages that you do use in your wider SEO strategy, such as product pages, category pages, blog articles, events pages and so on that drive traffic should continue to be optimised for that. It really isn‚Äôt possible to optimise for both. Don‚Äôt kill money making traffic for the sake of a slightly better rich sitelink. If you provide a quality meta title and description, the sitelink will always look pretty good. Just bear in mind  that they may well appear as a sitelink on your Brand SERP at some point.

Here are some tips for those pages that appear ONLY as sitelinks.

Meta titles
Now, might not directly influence whether or not Google uses a page as a sitelink, but it influences what is displayed when they are used. For ALL sitelink candidates, make sure you have written an appropriate meta title. You have control. Use it. Don‚Äôt rely on your CMS to choose one for you. 
The rules
1 - The meta title should be short and to the point. There isn't much space in sitelink titles - less than 30 characters. If the meta title is too long, Google will shorten it and what displays probably won‚Äôt be quite what you would like. 
2 - The meta title indicates clearly what the person will find on that page. For each page, stay focussed on what that page offers a user who already knows who you are.
3 - The meta title doesn't wax lyrical about your brand. In the context of your Brand SERP, the sitelink will appear in a very brand-specific context, underneath your homepage and surrounded by other information about you.  There is no need to re-explain what it is you do, what your USP is, or repeat your brand name - that information is already in the SERP. Potentially multiple times already. You can include your brand name in the meta title, but don‚Äôt weave it into a sentence, add it at the end of the title‚Ä¶ that way Google can (and will) simply remove it when showing it in a Brand SERP. 

The meta description is incredibly important. 
Make sure that you always have a meta description. If you don't have one, Google will choose a description from the page that it thinks is relevant ‚Ä¶ and Google doesn‚Äôt always make the best choice. If you provide the meta description, it will usually show that. 
But don‚Äôt rely on the default value your CMS chooses either. Control your brand message by writing a specific meta description for each page. Remember, this will display above the fold, front and centre, just below your homepage - in full sight for everyone who Googles your brand.
As with the meta title, keep it short, simple and focussed on what the page offers. And think about the context - the user searched for your brand and the SERP is full of information about your brand, and your brand name appears multiple times, so don‚Äôt overdo it! 

Content
Right at the top, include a clear explanation of what the user will find on that page - a text that describes the role of the page. That will help the user and encourage Google to show it as a sitelink more often. In the main copy on the page, only provide the information that is necessary for the person who is interested in that specific aspect of your brand.
 
For example, within the context of a search on your brand name, your About Us page needs to explain who you are, and why they would want to do business with you. 
The contact us page only needs to describe how they can contact you. 
A pricing page should be dominated by the actual pricing information. You are writing for somebody who knows who you are and are informing themselves about a specific aspect of your brand. You are not in heavy sales mode here. Don‚Äôt be pushy or oversell.

You can - and indeed should - include upsells and links to information about your products and services in the sidebar or underneath the content. 

Excluding pages
Previously, through Search Console, Google allowed site owners to specify pages they wanted to exclude, but it removed that possibility in 2018. Today, in order to instruct Google that you don‚Äôt want it to use a page, you need to noindex them. 
Just be aware of two things
1 - this will also exclude them from other search results
2 - noindex is not 100% effective since Google can choose to use pages even when they contain that code. 

You should noindex the legal pages - privacy policy, terms of use etc since those are really not interesting for your audience in the context of a Google search.

You might also want the search box. 
Before getting too excited, it is important to realise that Google will only add it to the Brand SERP if it feels that being able to search your site from Google will bring be helpful to its users. So if you have few pages, that is unlikely to be the case. You probably won‚Äôt get the search box. If you have a lot of pages, then you can expect Google to add it. And it looks really professional and gives you an extra bit of space on the SERP.

Here's an example of a fully owned brand site block

It‚Äôs important to note that when someone does use the search box, the user stays on Google. They simply get a new SERP for that search term, but with a set of results ONLY from your site.
So it makes sense that Google doesn‚Äôt add the search box for small sites. The results would look pretty lame.

One way to look at this is that Google adds the search box when it thinks that the site has so many pages that would be useful for direct access for the user that  the rich sitelinks aren‚Äôt enough. Adding the search box semi-solves this problem.

If you want a search box, you need to put this code in. Google won‚Äôt add the search box immediately, wait a few days. If it isn‚Äôt showing the search box then, there is nothing you can do to change that. But it might start using the search box in the future, so leave the code in place.

At this point, you have a great meta title, and meta description on your homepage, and you have triggered and optimised the rich sitelinks and you might also have the search box.
Your site controls about a quarter of the Brand SERPs that‚Äôs equivalent to three results. That is your brand message, controlled by you, top front and center showing to people who matter to your business."
Explanation of the Simple Techniques You Can Use to Improve Content on Websites You Control for Brand SERP Optimisation	"You‚Äôve got your homepage perfect. The meta title and description appear as you want them on your Brand SERP. The first thing people see now looks better. 
Next steps - other results you control directly
 This lesson is pretty short and will be useful to you only if you have other sites on other domains you control, or if you are an international brand. If not, then the only page you control  that is likely to rank on page #1 of your Brand SERP is your homepage. 
Why?
Because Google tries not to rank multiple results from the same site on a page of results. That is true for all SERPs, but especially true on Brand SERPs. It doesn‚Äôt want to give the brand too much of a voice about itself, which is fair enough. But then this course is all about making that whole Brand SERP YOUR voice :)
If another page from your site DOES rank on page #1 then a) you‚Äôre lucky and b) you should optimise it in the same manner you did your homepage. Make sure that the meta title and descriptions send out a positive, clear and convincing message.
Expect that page to disappear over time. Don‚Äôt work fervently to try to keep it ranking - Google will eventually ‚Äòdemote‚Äô it since it is very unlikely to really bring more value to Google‚Äôs users searching your brand name than a third party result. Also, from your perspective, if you CAN have a great positive result that is not from your site to replace this, that will look more authentic and convincing to your users. 
So work on making sure that content you semi-control and content you do not control is top-notch so that when Google DOES demote that page, there are great replacements ready to take its place.
Now, let‚Äôs look beyond your main site
Perhaps you have direct control over multiple sites. The one-result-per-site-per-SERP no longer applies. So these may well already appear. In that case, optimise them. If they don‚Äôt appear, but are on page 2 or 3, then they are great candidates to rank. They are valuable and useful to your audience, and that is what Google is looking for in Brand SERPs. So optimise them, even if they don‚Äôt rank page #1.
Two reasons 1) keep your brand message consistent across all sources 2) they may well rank sometime in the future
Here are some examples of sites you own that are great candidates for ranking on your Brand SERP :
Client support sites. Product sites. Outlet location sites. Human resources sites. Department sites‚Ä¶ you get the idea. You‚Äôll know which ones apply to you.
A quick note about blogs - having a low-quality, badly kept blog or other site just to try to occupy a place on your own Brand SERP is not a long term strategy. Even if it works short term, it won‚Äôt work long term - Google will understand what you are doing, and drop that satellite site from the SERP‚Ä¶

In the context of credibility, with second-rate, spammy sites and content you look bad. Brand credibility is phenomenally important today for your overall SEO strategy, so don‚Äôt do things that damage your credibility. The term Google use here is E-A-T. If you want to understand more about that, there is a link to Google‚Äôs Raters Quality Guidelines in the resources section of this lesson.
If you legitimately have a quality blog that uses another domain, then use it. That is a great candidate and will probably rank if you optimise it for that.
As a general rule, legitimate sites you own that are closely related to your core business often rank on your Brand SERP. So you need to optimise the pages from those that appear in the same way you optimised your homepage‚Ä¶ with the additional task of making sure that they reflect the brand image correctly and consistently. 
You might need to liaise with the people who run these sites and help them to do it. If that is the case, help them by preparing the work for them as far as is possible, reasonable and tactful. 
Here‚Äôs an example. Disney has their main site with their lovely sitelinks. But multiple other sites from multiple other departments also rank on their Brand SERP. 
Here‚Äôs another example - a customer care site ranking #2
And some more examples...
The danger with multiple sites like this is that sometimes the brand message across them lacks consistency. That is most often the case when they are each managed by a different team. But even if the same team managing diff√©rente sites, over time the messages can shift, almost inperceptibly. So even if you THINK it al all consistent, take this opportunity to check and correct.
  From a Brand SERP standpoint, these controlled sites are a great opportunity to control more of the Brand SERP and better communicate with a captive audience
If you are an international brand
You may have multiple sites across multiple countries, perhaps in multiple languages. It's amazing how often this gets forgotten. If you're an international company with language versions of your site, you need to make sure the different language versions reflect the same brand image as the original version.
That's for multiple reasons. 
Firstly your Brand SERP. In some circumstances, these language version can appear on your Brand SERP. For example, if I am searching in the UK using a browser set to French as the  default language, I will almost certainly see the French site somewhere on the Brand SERP. That might seem to be an edge case. But for an international brand, it isn‚Äôt. Check your Analytics to see how much countries, languages and browser preferences get mixed up and create these mixed results. 
Secondly, your users or your potential clients need to have a consistent message across countries and across languages. 
Thirdly, Google needs that consistent message. A consistent message is vital to ensure Google understands and is confident it has understood who you are and what you do. Watch the Knowledge Graph episode for more on why that is such a big problem.
If your message in French is completely different to the one in English, you're going to confuse Google about who you are and what it is you do. Obviously you need to adapt to the localization - different cultures require slightly different approaches - but don't adapt too much and lose focus on your brand message. It definitely isn‚Äôt good for Google. But probably isn‚Äôt for your audience either.
So you need to optimise the pages from all your language versions and internationalised versions in the same way you optimised your homepage. Once again, you may need to liaise with the people who run these sites and help them to do it. If that is the case, help them by preparing the work for them as far as is possible, reasonable and tactful. 
Whatever additional sites you own and run, it is vital to 
1- Optimise the meta title and description and make sure they are consistent with those on your homepage
2 - Add the favicon
3 - Add a featured image to the page
4 - and absolutely key in the bigger picture, beyond the visual aspect of the Brand SERP‚Ä¶ make sure that the brand message is coherent across every single one.
Google needs an accurate, clear and consistent message in order to fully understand who you are and what you do. Being accurate, clear and consistent across all your sites, and all the pages of your sites, creates is what creates the foundations of that understanding.
This is essential for the Knowledge Graph and credibility, which both play a vital role in the more advanced aspects of your Brand SERP that you will see in the other courses in this series, but also to your overall SEO and digital marketing strategy."
Explanation of the Simple Techniques You Can Use to Improve Content on Websites You Partially Control for Brand SERP Optimisation	"Here we have part of the first page of results for Ben and Jerry's. Looking at the domains you might imagine they have no control at all, but that's not true.

In fact, they have partial control over every single one of these results. There are many examples of results that a brand has partial control over... 

Examples of partially controlled results you can optimise very simply are - Twitter, Pinterest, Facebook, LinkedIn, Crunchbase, industry sites, Wikipedia, Amazon, review platforms, job platforms‚Ä¶

In this lesson, I‚Äôll focus on social media sites. There‚Äôs another lesson for the other sites I just mentioned.

Social media sites are great candidates for ranking on your Brand SERP because they are very relevant for people Googling your brand name. 

Importantly for your Brand SERP, you control part of the title and description that appears. On your Brand SERP that‚Äôs a big win. It‚Äôs a great opportunity for you, and definitely one not to be missed. 
Remember too that you also have a good amount of control over what appears in the page when someone clicks on the blue link in the SERP and visits the your social account homepage. 

For all social media accounts, the key factor Google is looking for is engagement. A social account is always a fairly good candidate for ranking on your Brand SERP, but a social account with lots of engagement from a relevant audience is a GREAT candidate.

Ongoing activity from you - and genuine engagement from your audience via comments, likes and shares - indicates to Google that the social media account is a valuable resource for people searching your brand. If you want a particular social media account to rank on YOUR Brand SERP, then you really need to make that account relevant and valuable to your audience and get them involved.

That said, the first job is to work on those that currently rank on the first two pages. Those on page #1 are top priority since everyone Googling your brand name sees them on your SERP. Those on page #2 are less urgent since few people click through to the second page these days. But do them anyway, they might well push up in rankings. If they do, it is better to be ready !

And also look at this from the wider perspective of your social media strategy. That is a vital part of your wider SEO strategy and global marketing strategy. You REALLY want to be looking after your social presence. 
And the immediate needs of your Brand SERP is a great place to start building that strategy.
  They are the platforms that will enable you to interact with existing clients, and build a wider audience who are truly interested in what you have to offer. 

In the context of improving your Brand SERP, we are just looking at those that rank page  #1 and #2.

A quick word about Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn - if you have a profile, it will tend to rank, even if there is little activity. 
In the context of the Brand SERP, you need to deal with at least what shows on Google. Beyond that, if they really aren‚Äôt useful to you, then delete the account so that your more valuable social media accounts have a better chance of ranking. 
You might also want to think about pushing any less-than-truly-valuable social platforms off page #1 using the techniques described in the ‚ÄúDealing With Unwanted Content‚Äù course.

What Google shows in the SERP
What title and description appear in Google depends on the way the platform deals with meta titles and descriptions.
Most social platforms use your brand name, plus their brand name as the meta title, and that is what appears as a blue link in your Brand SERP. It varies between platforms, but there is always a system. It might be your handle, plus a standard text. Or your handle and the social platform name. Or the title of your account, plus their name. Check on your SERP what appears, look where they are pulling the text from and adapt accordingly. 

Many social platforms give you the opportunity to add a description to your account. ALWAYS take that opportunity. They will sometimes use that as the meta description‚Ä¶ and that is usually what Google will use. But even if it doesn‚Äôt appear on your Brand SERP on Google, it is an opportunity to communicate an attractive message on your profile page on that platform. So add a description whenever you have the opportunity and make sure it is positive, informative and attractive. 

Some platforms don‚Äôt give you a description field, and some give you one but don‚Äôt push it to Google. The actual description that Google uses in your Brand SERP varies from platform to platform, so check on your SERP to see if that is what appears, then optimise accordingly. Make it look as good as possible in Google‚Äôs SERP.

Some specifics about major platforms - Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Instagram
These are just the platforms I have seen most often on Brand SERPs. If the social platform that ranks on your SERP isn‚Äôt in this list, then use the approach I just explained to figure out what you need to change to make the result optimal for your Brand SERP.

Twitter
Twitter has a special place in Brand SERPs since Twitter feeds directly into Google. As such, it is the best social platform to have up there on your Brand SERP. Whatever you post there goes straight into Google. 
Importantly, Twitter offers a rich element all of its own - Twitter Boxes. These look great, they are really sexy on mobile and provide you with a high level of control, so they are well worth having. 

In the rich elements course there is a lesson on how to trigger and optimise these. 

But in the context of optimising this result that you semi-control, the first thing to do is get the title right. Google shows what you enter in the ‚Äòname‚Äô field, then your Twitter handle, and then their own brand name. So make sure your name and Twitter handle make sense. 
The description Google shows is most often ‚ÄúThe latest Tweets from‚Äù, then your Twitter handle, then the description on your Twitter account. Make sure you have a description on Unwanted and that it‚Äôs positive, attractive and looks good on the SERP.
Sometimes, Google will show one of your recent Tweets - most often the one with the most engagement. So make sure you write great Tweets!

Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and other social platforms
Unlike Twitter, there is no direct feed, and no extra rich result to be triggered. But they rank easily and naturally on Brand SERPs, so making sure the title and description represent your brand is very very important. 

Facebook gives a simple title with the name of your brand, then the type of Facebook page, then their brand name. Then the description contains some data about your account‚Ä¶ this changes, it can be likes, friends, reviews and many other of the numbers they collect, so check out which yours shows and improve those. After a number or two, Google shows the start of your description, so make sure you put the best bits at the start of your description!

Facebook is the platform with the most bells and whistles. That means there are many parts of your Facebook profile that your audience might want to access directly from the SERP. So, with Facebook you can sometimes get sitelinks. If you have multiple elements within your Facebook page, and they are active and attract engagement, Google MIGHT show them as sitelinks in the Facebook result on your Brand SERP. And it looks pretty good. So you want to use all the Facebook options that are relevant for your brand. Bear in mind ‚Äòrelevant‚Äô. It can be tempting to add every option and functionality that Facebook offers. But if it isn‚Äôt relevant, your audience won‚Äôt engage, and it won‚Äôt improve either your Brand SERP or your Facebook strategy. You‚Äôll be wasting your time.

If you have multiple Facebook pages and profiles, perhaps for different countries, languages, products or departments, make sure that they all link to each other logically within Facebook, since they may well turn up as sitelinks.

Furthermore, if you have reviews on Facebook, the rating and review stars will sometimes show in the SERPs. Reviews will encourage Google to rank your Facebook profile higher, and they look great when the rating is 4 stars or more. Anything less looks bad. So make sure you GET 4 stars or more, and make sure you maintain a good score. 

Importantly, Facebook ranks really easily, whether you are active on Facebook or not. So once you have a Facebook profile, it is really important to maintain, manage and optimise it over time.

Also, keep an eye out for Facebook local business listings. They don‚Äôt dominate like Google My Business, but they do sometimes rank, and most of the time they are incomplete, dull and not very positive for your brand. If you have one appearing on your Brand SERP, make the most of it in the short term and optimise it‚Ä¶ but in the long term, you‚Äôll want to drown it.

LinkedIn
In the blue link title, Google will just show your brand name and the LinkedIn brand name. Nothing much you can do there.
But you can make the result look better by providing a tagline. If you provide a tagline, Google will sometimes show that. If you don‚Äôt, Google will show the default LinkedIn description, which is REALLY boring. So make sure you provide a tagline and make the most of LinkedIn because LinkedIn ranks very well - even more easily than Facebook for brands. 

YouTube 
Google shows the channel title and the YouTube brand name as the blue link in the SERP. So make sure you get the channel name right.
The description Google shows will be your channel description if you add one to YouTube. If not, it will show the title of your latest video. 

Instagram
Rarely ranks, and this one is pretty dull, and not optimisable. Just your Account name, handle, then ‚ÄúInstagram photos and videos‚Äù. The description is just facts and figures about your account. So your best bet for a great description is getting posting more, getting more followers and more likes.

Pinterest
As with Instagram, this rarely ranks, but is a lot more controllable. The title is account name, then your handle, then ‚Äúon Pinterest‚Äù.
The description is the description you give on your Pinterest account. So make sure that is really attractive and convincing.

Other than social media   
I‚Äôm not going to go into details since each platform is very specific. You need to find which social channels rank in your Brand SERP‚Ä¶ if a smaller platform is ranking  that is an indication that it is relevant to your brand and your audience‚Ä¶. And therefore worth working on in your wider social strategy. In the context of this course, optimise what appears in your Brand SERP. The amount of control you have will vary. But once again, make the most of the opportunities.

Whatever social accounts you are using - optimise what is visible on your Brand SERP. But ideally, take it further and also take the time to optimise the landing page - optimise every piece of information the platform allows you to provide. Remember people actually click on these results sometimes - you want to make sure they see something that is engaging, and that is positive and accurate for your brand. More than that, Google takes all this information into account when evaluating the credibility of your brand. 

Short and long term
Importantly, in the short term, optimise the social channels that currently rank, but longer term, you want to build a solid social media strategy - and that means focussing on social channels that are truly relevant and valuable to your audience. 

If they are truly relevant, and you can keep your account fresh, active and relevant‚Ä¶ and get genuine engagement from an audience that is truly interested in your business, then they WILL rank over time. And your Brand SERP will look all the more relevant and attractive to your target audience

Thank you"
Explanation of the Simple Techniques You Can Use to Improve Content on Websites You Do Not Control for Brand SERP Optimisation	"When content from a third party ranks, and that content doesn't necessarily represent your brand, your brand message, or perhaps it isn't incredibly positive. Or it could just be better.

If you‚Äôve picked this result out it is because the blue link and description on your Brand SERP and sub-optimal. If it‚Äôs outright bad, this lesson probably won‚Äôt help, and you‚Äôll need to take the course about Dealing With Negative Content.

When it is simply less-than-perfect, this lesson is perfect. 

First and foremost, you are looking to get the meta title and description changed so that the message on your Brand SERP is more positive and accurate. If you CAN get that changed, then you might also think about pushing further, as I‚Äôll explain later.

You don't have any control over that result, but that doesn't mean to say you can't act and get that result improved.

Here's what to do. 

First, bear in mind that behind that content is a person, possibly several people. That is easy to forget on the internet.

It's all about relationships. If you want to convince someone to change a page on their site to help you, then start by building a relationship. There's no point in just saying ‚ÄúI want this change‚Äù right off the bat. Even with someone you know, that wouldn‚Äôt be an approach that would often end in success.

So, you need to build a relationship. 

Get an introduction from a mutual acquaintance. This is a really good way to start, so try this first. See if you know someone who knows them and ask for an introduction. Being recommended by a person you both know is absolutely perfect.

You might also be able to start with a face to face. If that is possible, go for that. Perhaps the person responsible for the content - a journalist, blogger, siteowner or webmaster goes to meetups near you. Or conferences you attend. Strike up a conversation at one of these offline events. 

If neither of those work, connect on social media. LinkedIn is great for that because it is a work-related platform for professionals. 

Add a note when connecting if you have something to say that will be of interest to them. If not, don‚Äôt. Saying ‚ÄúI run a great website that sells widgets and I‚Äôd like to connect with you‚Äù is both self-centered and lame. Writing a note implies you expect a reply and you are putting pressure on them, right from the off. 

The idea here is just to get your name onto their horizon. They‚Äôll see the connection request and at least skim read your name, and importantly, see your photo. However vague, you have your name and face in their minds.

Follow them on Twitter too. Don‚Äôt overdo the connections on too many platforms. Avoid stalking them - that doesn‚Äôt send out a very good signal. 

Only once you have some kind of contact with them can you think about approaching them to make the changes you want.

Don‚Äôt rush it. This isn‚Äôt like linkbuilding where you might shoot off emails to 30 people and hope that a couple reply. There is only one person here. And that person is sitting on your Brand SERP. And they are the only person that can help you. If you rush in and get it wrong, the game is over. 

When you do contact them, you need to figure out how to approach this in a manner where they want to dialogue with you. For that, they have to see value for them in this relationship. You need to bring value to them. 

Starting the conversation is the real toughie.

Most of the time, email is most appropriate. You might want to try calling - there is no reason not to. Speaking to people can be really effective. Email or phone is a judgement call you need to make.
I‚Äôll focus on email in this lesson.

 Here's an example of the start of an email that you might initially write and be tempted to send. 
‚ÄúI am Bob Linton and my company sells widgets that we ship from our state of the art warehouse in Ohio, and we are wonderful.‚Äù

That‚Äôs how most of us write naturally. From our point of view, talking about ourselves. But put yourself in their shoes - what they're hearing very loudly is ‚ÄúI, me, mine‚Äù. Very few people enjoy listening to other people talk only about themselves. Most people react well when things are presented from their point of view. So you need to present things from their point of view. Make the email much more about them. 

‚ÄúYour article about the current state of the widget industry in Saint Louis has generated some great feedback for my company Bob Linton. Thanks for the positive mention. The article currently ranks incredibly well on searches for my brand, which is also really positive for us. Perhaps we could have a chat to discuss how we can make that article work even better for both of us.‚Äù

The first person I mention is them. Great start. Then I mention myself and create a link between them and my brand. Then I create a relationship in their mind with the word ‚Äúwe‚Äù - and suggest that relationship will be mutually beneficial. 

 Here's another example.
‚ÄúI think your article gives a great overview of what Kalicube offers. We recently updated our product specs, so please update your article accordingly.‚Äù

That sounds fine. But I start with a reference to me, the writing is passive, the message isn't very exciting... and once again, we're not addressing it from their point of view.

Think about what makes them tick. 

This would have a better chance of success.
‚ÄúYour article gives a great overview of what Kalicube offers and you have sent quite a few happy customers our way over the last year. Thank you. We updated our product specs last week, so the information in your article is no longer 100% up-to-date. Could you spare a little time to chat so I can share the details? Please let me know when would suit you. Looking forward to chatting with you.‚Äù

That's really positive. Talking about it more from their point of view, making them the initial focus... even though it's really all about us. 

And we're making them feel that we really want to talk to them. We want to engage with them. We want to build a relationship. 

Importantly, don't use template emails. Each case is unique, and each individual is different. If you want to build a relationship, you really don't want to use a template email. You only have one shot at this.

Now, next step is to convince them to make the changes. For that, you need to bring value to them

You're asking them to change their meta title or their meta description. They might do it out of the kindness of their heart. But most of the time, they will need to see some benefit them if they do it. What benefits? Explain that the content will get better rankings on the search terms it ranks for. Plus, it may start ranking for other search terms. In both cases, they will get more visibility and probably more traffic. Also, their page looks better in Google‚Äôs SERPs for every search term it ranks for. There‚Äôs some value.

So, if you can demonstrate that this will bring benefits to them, they will change it and they will change it with pleasure‚Ä¶ and then, who knows? Your relationship may develop and bring you most things further down the line.

If they are resistant to changing, it might be useful to point out that the m√©tas are only visible on Google‚Äôs results, the visitors actually consuming the content on their site will see no difference.
But don't bully them. 
Remember it is their content and their site. If they don't want to change it then leave it. It almost certainly isn‚Äôt their priority. They are very probably busy on other more important things. Or it might be that they don‚Äôt like you sticking your nose in their business.
So, drop it. You can try again after a few months - they might be more open, especially if you can find a better way to communicate the benefits this change will bring them. 

In the meantime, if there are results below it that are better for your Brand SERP, you can work on pushing THAT result above this one. The Pushing results off your SERP course is full of techniques to do that.

So here are some examples. 

Here's a result that‚Äôs pretty boring. It's not really sexy. It's not brilliant. It is easy to make this more attractive. And a better meta title and description like this is good for example.com and for you. Reach out to the person, ask them to change it - better m√©tas will help their rankings and click through rate on all search terms, so THAT is the value to them. 

Here's an example of a review.
Somebody who's given a review of the services and products, they obviously like it, but they haven't been incredibly enthusiastic.Ask them to change the meta title and meta description. If you think they are open to the idea, offer to provide them.  

If the site owner does accept that you provide the title and description be careful not to get selfish. Write it so it will look great on your SERP to your audience, but also it will look better to THEIR audience, and potentially rank for more search terms, bringing them additional traffic - remember that the benefit they get is better SEO for THEM. 
Maybe something like this. 

You can also help them make the result look more attractive by suggesting that they give you a rating. In that case, you would need to provide them with the relevant review schema markup. Look at Google‚Äôs examples for how to do that.
If they don‚Äôt know how to add the markup to their page, help them with that too. Just be careful not to step on any toes - you have no idea about their internal politics and at this point you are getting pretty involved. 

Here again, you're bringing value to them. They're getting something for free, and you are getting a better Brand SERP.

If the situation suits, then you can push further and really nail their spot on your Brand SERP.
Be careful only to do this if you are really happy for that result to stay there. If the content on the page is neutral or only semi-positive for you, then don‚Äôt suggest any changes beyond  what is visible on your SERP - the metas.

If you have SEO skills, you might want to help them make the overall content better to improve their rankings across the board with that content. Of course, your win is that the page will become more solid in your SERP, and perhaps even rank higher. Assuming the m√©tas are wonderful, the content is great, and the rating they give you is 5 out of 5, that is wonderful news for you  :)

Once again, both parties get value. And at this stage, you'll have a relationship. They will appreciate the help you gave, and that will probably pay a second time somewhere down the line.

Obviously there is  a vast range of possibilities out there, and I can‚Äôt cover them all.
But, as long as the content isn‚Äôt negative, the approach is always the same. 

Reach out, build a relationship and suggest changes that bring benefit to them."
Explanation of the Simple Techniques You Can Use Google Ads for Brand SERP Optimisation	"Google Ads is a really really easy place to start to improve your Brand SERPs. 
Google Ads are front and center and right at the top ... and you have full control. 

What are your main aims when using Google Ads to improve your Brand SERPs? 

Firstly, You want to dominate. 
With a well optimised ad for your brand on your Brand SERP, 
you get a really nice big chunk of real estate right at the top ... 
and that real estate is dedicated to your brand and 
your brand message ... 

Now, I am sure you want to control your brand message as much as possible.  
Here is an opportunity to do so. 
You choose what you put in your ads, and Google will display it because you're paying. 
So you can control your brand message  front and center, 
right at the top. 

Secondly you want to retain existing clients. Existing clients search your brand name simply to navigate to your site. 

In my experience, most brands underestimate this aspect of brand searches and Brand SERPs... 
It is highly probable that existing clients search for your brand name in Google more than you think. 
Why do they search your brand name?
 Because they don't remember the 
domain name, 
they don't have a bookmark... 
or maybe just because they are lazy. And remember, people are getting lazier and lazier
so the volume of brand searches is going to increase in the coming years. 

So‚Ä¶ your clients are navigating to your site by searching in Google for your brand name. 

They are looking to get to specific areas 
of your site. 

Make sure your ads give your existing customers the option of clicking straight through to the different areas of your site they are likely to be interested in 
- the login page
or the after sales service section
or the blog,
Are good examples.

To do this, you will need to use sitelink extensions 
(we'll look at those
later on in this tutorial)  

Thirdly, You want to convert valuable leads. 
Some people are searching your brand name because they already visited once and are interested in your products or services‚Ä¶
Or because they have heard about you through another channel 

Either way, they Googled your brand name with intention 
of  learning more about you. 
You want to make sure that the ad you push to the top convinces them that you ARE the brand they want to do business with. 

All of that is just you in isolation 
with your ad 
on your Brand SERP.

But Your competitors may be bidding on your brand name. 
What happens here?

In this example there is quite a lot of action from multiple competitors.
They are trying to steal leads. 
But they're also trying to steal existing customers. 
The danger is real in both cases.

But ! 

There is a BIG problem for your competitors.
Their campaigns on your brand name are unlikely to be directly profitable... 

And you can make things worse for them by optimising your branded Google Ads campaigns. 

Optimising YOUR campaigns will 
reduce your cost, 
improve your profitability, 
‚Ä¶ and also push costs up for your competitors, 
making their campaigns even less profitable ... 

And that could ultimately mean that they get off your Brand SERP. 

What are the mechanics that allow you to push their costs up by pushing your costs down?

The key is Quality Score. 
Google rewards ads that satisfy its users. The mechanism it uses to evaluate that satisfaction is 
Quality Score. 
Higher Quality Score means lower 
cost per click. 

Quality Score is calculated based on three signals -
 expected click through rate, 
ad relevance 
and landing page experience.

On your exact match brand term, you should easily score highly on all three‚Ä¶

 and so your quality score is likely to be 
10 out of 10 without much effort. 


Your competitors, on the other hand
 will have a significantly lower click through rate, 
their ad will be less relevant 
and they will have a lower score for landing page experience 
since the user is looking for you, not them.

Since your competitors perform less well on all three metrics, they
will have a lower quality score, and therefore a higher cost per click.


That all means that your competitors 
are paying way more than you for a click on your branded terms. 
Up to 10 times more, which is why it is difficult for them to make Google ad campaigns on your brand name profitable.

And, as I mentioned earlier, 
if you fully optimise YOUR campaigns on your brand name, 
you can make life even more difficult 
for your competitors!

As your Quality Score goes up
Theirs will go down.

As your costs fall
Theirs will rise‚Ä¶

Perhaps you can force their costs to rise to the point where they give up, 
and drop their campaigns on your Brand SERPs altogether 
‚Ä¶chasing them off your Brand SERP, 

So this is well worth doing properly :)

As I said earlier on, you should have above average 
for the expected click through rate, 
the ad relevance 
and the landing page experience. 
You should have a Quality Score of 
 10 out of 10 

You might think you have nailed it.
But you haven‚Äôt.

It's important to remember that the score Google shows you is not very granular ‚Ä¶
 even if you've got 
10 out of 10 
and you're above average for all three, you can almost certainly do 
MUCH better. 

My experience has been that, even when it's at 10, you can push your quality score up further.
You won‚Äôt see the Quality Score increase, but you will see cost per click fall as you optimise
You will be very pleasantly surprised :)

I have seen clients make savings of 30% when they implement the tactics I'm about to show you. 

So what do you 
need to do?

 First off, protect your trademark. 
A lot of brands don't do this.

If you don‚Äôt protect your trademark in Google Ads,
 your competitors will be able to use your  trademark in their ad copy.
That helps improve their click through rate and thus improve their Quality Score and cut their costs. 

You can stop them.

You just need to fill in this form.

 BUT‚Ä¶ You need to hold the trademark in the territory you are asking to be protected‚Ä¶
so make sure you've got the trademark and have the relevant reference numbers to prove it. 

You also need examples of other brands using your brand name in their ad copy. 

Unfortunately, you can't do protect your brand name proactively. 
Google asks you to prove that somebody is using your brand term. 

So, Make sure you've got your trademark in the country you're looking to protect.
Find an example.  And then fill in the form, submit it‚Ä¶

and your competitors will no longer be able to use your trademark in their ad copy

That adds an additional handicap on your brand terms - it will reduce their click through rate, push their quality score down, 
and their costs 
will rise. 

Now onto saving money for yourself. 
Remember, this could save you something in the region of 30%
And once you have gone through and set all this up, 
 very little maintenance will be necessary
It isn‚Äôt quite 
‚Äòset it and forget it‚Äô.
But not far off :)

As I mentioned, 
even with a Quality Score of 10 out of 10, you can almost certainly push your Quality Score up. 

The score Google shows you is a rough guide.

So, even though you won't see your score increasing, there IS room to improve, and pull costs down. A lot of room !"
Explanation of the Simple Techniques You Can Use to Improve Quality Score in Google Ads for Brand SERP Optimisation	"To save money, 
you need to focus on the three things that affect quality score, 
ad relevance,
 landing page experience, 
and expected click through rate. 

What can you do?

Firstly, ad relevance.
For exact match 
on your own 
brand name, 
you will always
 be very relevant.
So make sure you have an Ad Group that is exact match. 
No other terms should enter this Ad Group. 
That way, the Quality Score for your exact match brand name is as high as it can possibly be.

If you want to target a broader set of branded keywords, 
put them in separate Ad Groups

If you have multiple languages, 
make sure that you have a campaigns for each of those languages. 
That way you can accurately target the language using
 the settings 
at campaign level

And that will minimise wasted spend on ads showing to people in the wrong language.

Next.
Make sure you target the country correctly. 
Once again in settings at campaign level.
If you have multiple countries, 
then you may want 
to consider creating specific campaigns for each.
Even with the same language, culture can change enormously between countries.
In such cases, 
you would want to adapt the way you address the audience according to the cultural differences between the populations of the countries. 
For example a campaign aimed at the North Amercian market would have slightly different spellings and use a slightly different vocabulary to one that addresses the UK‚Ä¶
And it may also contain a more ‚Äòpushy‚Äô sales tone, 
or put offers more 
to the fore. 

Remember, even if you have Above Average for the Expected Click Through rate, 
that does not mean you have fully optimised. 
It just means you are‚Ä¶
Above Average
Not necessarily perfect‚Ä¶
Or even excellent
For that matter :)

Secondly, landing page experience

Many brands use their homepage as the landing page for branded campaigns 
in Google ads. 
Perhaps you are?
That's fine. 
IF your homepage 
has a very 
brand-focussed message.
If you have optimised your homepage for other terms, then it probably is not going to perform optimally for exact match 
brand searches.
You might want to create a dedicated landing page
that allows you to get a hyper focussed brand message across to people who click on your ad.
Your onpage message needs to focus on who you are, what you do and why the person would want to do business with you - what is your unique selling point ?
Tell them.
If your landing page nails that, 
the landing page factor of your quality score will go WAY up. 

When deciding whether to create a dedicated landing page or not, 
just ask yourself, 
does your 
homepage give
an uncluttered, 
clear and convincing reason for someone to do business 
with you ?
If not, create a dedicated brand landing page for Google Ads.

You could go even further and have a different landing page for each of the audiences we will discuss later 
- customers, hot prospects, prospects and newcomers.

You need to make sure that your 
landing page 
is mobile friendly. 
 
If your landing page does not deliver a GREAT user experience for them,
many people on mobile devices will return to the SERP, and your quality score will go down‚Ä¶
 and your costs will go up. 

You want your landing page to be fast. 
 
If people 
have to wait too long, 
they get frustrated, 
they bounce,
quality score 
goes down, 
prices go up. 

Great user experience and super fast sitespeed are fundamentally important on mobile devices‚Ä¶
 and mobile devices are more and more prevalent in search. 
Check what percentage of people Googling your brand name are doing so on mobile - that will motivate you to make the effort to perfect these aspects of your landing page experience.

Importantly, 
even if you have Above Average Quality Score 
for Landing Page Experience, 
that does not mean you have fully optimised. 
It just means 
you are‚Ä¶
Above Average
You are not necessarily perfect‚Ä¶

Thirdly, 
Click through rate
This is often the biggest winner. 

What affects the click through rate ?
Every piece of copywriting from the title to the description to every single extension.

Your title needs to contain your 
brand name. 
You might want to 
Add the registered trademark. 
That's a really nice trick for 
catching the eye.
But more than anything, 
your title 
needs to be enticing. 
It needs to 
attract the eye, 
and encourage 
the click. 

You need to provide at least two descriptions
Google can use any one of the descriptions 
you provide.

Sometimes it will 
use two.
So make sure they fit together.

The role of the description in 
a Brand Ad is to communicate your brand message and entice the click.
Make sure 
you write them 
with that in mind.

As with any Google Ads campaign, extensions are vital.
They are often underestimated, 
or forgotten entirely.
They give you
 more real estate, 
allow you to provide a more complete message and provide more opportunities to convince the user to click on your ad.
And the more you provide, the more Google can test which ones, and what combination 
works best for 
your brand.
 
Here's some callouts.
I like callouts a lot. 
Google uses them
A LOT
And they are an amazing opportunity for you to provide extra information about your brand.

Information that you are putting front and center for people who just searched your brand name. 

Next. Sitelinks. 
I love sitelinks even more than I love callouts :)
They allow the person who searched your brand name to access a specific area of your website directly.
That saves them time, and they will thank you for it.

It also increases the amount of real estate your ad occupies.
And that means 
your ad dominates 
above the fold 
on your Brand SERP.

If you give descriptions for EVERY single sitelink extension, they look like this and can more than double the real estate your ad occupies.
And that is 
above the fold, 
and your ad 
becomes VERY difficult to miss :)
If you don't put 
the descriptions
 for your sitelinks, 
you won't get this really nice chunk of real estate 
at the top of 
the SERP.
And remember 
this is real estate
 where you control the message.
And it is top, front and center.

Callouts and Sitelinks apply to any brand‚Ä¶ But don‚Äôt waste any opportunity :)

 Here's a list 
of the extensions 
you can use. 
I won‚Äôt go into detail since, other than the callouts and sitelinks, they are not useful to everyone. 
So look up how they work on Google Ads help here

And use as many as are truly useful 
to you‚Ä¶ 
and your target audience.

Site links, 
call outs, 
structured snippets, 
call extensions, 
message extensions, location extensions, 
affiliate location extensions, 
price extensions,
 app extensions, 
promotion extensions, 
and lead form extensions.

All of these help you get your message across better, 
give you more real estate front and center at the top of the SERP
‚Ä¶ improve click through rate
‚Ä¶push your QUality Score up
‚Ä¶and push your cost per click down
‚Ä¶and push your competitors away. 

The next step.

Choose your strategy. 
Choose ‚Äúoutrank a specific competitor‚Äù.

If somebody is being very aggressive on your brand term, 
you can choose 
to outrank them 
to make sure 
they're below you.
OR
you can aim to be top of the page
whoever's bidding on your brand keyword. 
That means Google will place you top of page front and center.

In neither case 
will you win 
100% of the time - Google always leaves itself a little margin 
to manoeuvre.

 However, both of those strategies can prove to be costly. 
If your competitors are bidding 
very aggressively, 
Perhaps running loss-leader campaigns‚Ä¶ using these strategies can push your costs up significantly and your costs can easily get out of control.

That is why 
I tend to use 
cost per acquisition.
That means I am sure that I will make money from the campaign.
I don't mind being second or third as long as people clicking on my ad make me money. Being first 
and losing money doesn‚Äôt make business sense 
in the long term.
That said, 
if you need to defend your space 
in your industry, 
or if there is a short term war that you have to win 
at all costs, 
then top of page or outrank a competitor can be more appropriate.

In the vast majority 
of cases, 
CPA really should be the long term strategy

 Now, when you are organizing your ads into ad Groups and Campaigns, 
ask yourself who is searching? 
There are 
- existing clients
- hot prospects, ready to buy
- prospects just learning who you are and what you offer
- and finally newcomers who know your brand 
only from second hand sources.

You should create audiences for 
each of these.

Create the audiences in Analytics and import them into Google Ads.

You can then create Ad Groups or campaigns for each.
And tailor the message accordingly.

Create audiences 
for existing clients, hot prospects, prospects‚Ä¶
Then the audience 
for newcomers is everyone who isn‚Äôt in one of the first three audiences :)

Existing clients.
Existing clients need a specific message. 
This is all about retention.
You need to 
keep them. 
You don't need to convert them.  
The ad should reassure them that they are are working with the right brand.

Then Sitelinks provide them with improved usability.
An easy, direct access to the parts of the site they are looking for‚Ä¶ The login page,
the after sales service
‚Ä¶or perhaps the blog

Hot prospects
These are people who have visited your site multiple times
or perhaps people who have signed up for a free trial.
In either case they they are keen.
They just need a nudge over the finishing line.
Perhaps a sales-y message would help.
Perhaps a special, short term offer

Prospects
These are people who have visited your site once or twice.
They are still in the consideration phase.
Encourage them to engage further with your brand. 
Don‚Äôt oversell or bully.

So that's three 
very specific types
of people.
Create audiences for each so that you can create dedicated, highly targeted campaigns using the include audience feature in 
Google Ads. 

Anyone left over is 
A newcomer.
These are people who have never visited your site 
And have therefore not seen your message through in an environment you control.
Think multichannel marketing. 
Perhaps they have seen you on social media, or on TV. 
Perhaps they read an article about you
Or saw your CMO on a webinar
They haven‚Äôt heard your brand message from you
Here is your opportunity 
to provide a great teaser right on the SERP
COAX them into your site 
so you can give them the full brand message.
And convert them into a prospect or hot prospect‚Ä¶
Then a client
To create the newcomers campaign,
simply exclude the other audiences.

Copywriting in ads is incredibly important. 
You have limited space so you need to be clear, concise and yet convincing.
That is a tough balance to strike.
You won‚Äôt 
get it right first time
‚Ä¶ be prepared to write and rewrite your copy multiple times before you get that balance right.
Once you have found the right balance, 
the copy for your branded ads 
will need 
very little tweaking. 
So take the time 
and be patient 
to get it right 
at the start.
It pays.

A few pointers
There's no need to introduce yourself. 
If they're searching for your brand, 
they already know who you are 
to some extent. 
You don‚Äôt need 
to introduce, 
but you DO need to ensure your brand name appears 
in the title, 
simply because seeing the brand name reassures people.
They searched the brand name. 
They expect to see it in the blue link. 

The texts for the descriptions and extensions need to use a consistent voice that resonates with your target audience‚Ä¶
And makes sense 
for you as a brand. 

It is vital that your copywriting communicates 
a message 
that makes
 your audience 
trust you, 
and encourages  them to believe 
that you are going 
to be a good partner for them.

Be positive, be helpful and be honest.
Be clear, be concise and be convincing. 

Here's a good example.
 I'll let you read it. 

Now back to the situation 
where your competitors 
are not bidding on your brand term.

I would advise 
you to create a campaign
and optimise it 
because doing so allows you to 
truly dominate your Brand SERP, 
protect your brand image 
and communicate your brand message 
in the way you want to ‚Ä¶ top front and center.

That said,
if your Brand SERP looks great and your competitors are not going to intrude, 
you can reasonably choose not to advertise. 

Lastly, what not to do.

 Don't forget the context.
The person who's searching your brand is in the context of your Brand SERP
Don‚Äôt be overly aggressive.
There is no need.
They Googled your brand name.
They know who you are.

If have segmented your audiences 
as I described earlier, 
Then you can 
adapt the message 
to the audience
and coax them appropriately.

Don't waste money. Make sure that 
you are optimising 
all three aspects of the Quality Score.
And revisit your campaigns regularly. 
If you set them and forget them, 
your Quality Score will drop steadily, 
and you will 
waste money. 
How often is ‚Äòregularly‚Äô?
Once optimised, 
you do not need to revisit them every day
‚Ä¶perhaps not even every week if your competitors are not very active on your Brand SERP.
But monthly is an absolute minimum.
Just to ensure 
that everything is performing 
as you want, 
that your costs 
aren't going up. 
That you aren‚Äôt wasting money"
Explanation of the Simple Technical SEO Techniques You Can Use to Improve Content for Brand SERP Optimisation	"In order to influence your Brand SERPs, you need to know some pretty snazzy SEO tactics. I'm going to teach you the techniques you will need to optimise your Brand SERP. Luckily for you, these tactics are also very very useful for any non-brand SEO you are working on.

In this lesson I‚Äôll take you through the major factors you need to look at in SEO, and also the major levers you have at your disposal. It is designed simply to give you an overview of SEO in the context of Brand SERPs that will help you throughout the courses - it isn‚Äôt a definitive SEO guide :)

As you go through the lessons and courses, I will explain the theory and specific techniques in much more detail as and when needed with explicit examples and actionable advice.

A quick explanation of SEO pre 2013
Here we have a SERP. SERP stands for search engine result page.  There are 10 blue links, and the aim of the game is to push YOUR blue link right to the top, 

At that time, before 2013, the whole game was about counting.  Google would count the number and ratio of words. It would count the inbound links, and then it would calculate a ranking  according to the words and the inbound links. 

That is a hyper simplified explanation that serves the purpose of setting the scene for Hummingbird.

In 2013 Google released hummingbird, and hummingbird changes the game. Instead of looking at strings, they're looking at things.  What does that mean? It means that Google ‚Äúunderstands‚Äù. Instead of just counting the words and counting the links, it understands who you are and what you do. When a user searches, Google evaluates the match between the intent of the user and its understanding of the solution you can provide, and the quality of your solution. 

In the case of Brand SERPs, the intent has always been fairly obvious - the person is researching you or navigating to your site. In that sense, nothing changes for Brand SERPs.

What DOES change the game in Brand SERPs is the introduction of rich elements. We don't just have the 10 blue links like we used to. We have more multimedia. Google wants to become multimedia. It has always wanted to provide the best possible experience for its users and today, that means multimedia. Multimedia on the SERP. That changes the SEO game. 

For Brand SERPs this a wonderful change of game. Brand SERPs look MUCH MUCH better than they used to, making them a more effective way to communicate with your audience. PLus the rich elements bring a wide variety of additional opportunities, additional techniques ‚Ä¶ and it makes optimising them more fun. They also mean that your Brand SERP on Google looks more and more like a fully fledged landing page for your brand.

Here are some examples of these rich elements that we can apply SEO tactics to. Three things: 1) this list is not complete, 2) the list of rich √©l√©ments gets longer all the time 3) not of them  appear on Brand SERPs

The featured snippet, video boxes, Twitter boxes, people also ask, related searches, Google my business, Google maps, the Knowledge Panel, top stories, image blocks, events, people also search for, similar places, stock prices, search box, and podcasts.

These rich elements are killing off blue links. Not only are there less traditional blue links like this on the SERP, but the ones that remain are less visible since they are overpowered by their sexy new siblings.

The key here is that if we want to be present in this situation, we need to provide suitable, relevant content for those rich elements. A balanced multim√©dia content strategy on multiple platforms that contains content in  many formats is the key. 

There is a course in this series that covers these rich elements and another that covers content strategy. Although both focus on Brand SERP, they are both very useful for your wider digital marketing strategy.

So what are the important SEO tactics for Brand SERPs?

Let‚Äôs start with technical.
On the technical side, the content you are pushing on your Brand SERP needs to be crawlable, indexable, fast, mobile friendly, organised in blocks and use structured data. Those are the foundations. Without these the content you are working to push up onto your Brand SERP will not perform.

There are other technical aspects that help in SEO, but they're not so very important for Brand SERPs. 

So in practical terms, what do we need to do? 

Crawlability simply means making sure Google is allowed to crawl the pages - so not blocked in robots.txt. Crawlability also means that there is a clear and simple path to each page from the homepage via the internal linking in the site.

Indexability - make sure that Google can actually add the content to its index. That means the pages you are pushing into the Brand SERP do not have the noindex tag, and that the HTML is sufficiently clean for Google to be able to extract the content reliably.

Fast - ideally the pages you are trying to rank should load in under 2 seconds on a 3G connection. If that isn‚Äôt feasible, it isn‚Äôt a show-stopper in the context of Brand SERPs. But a page that takes over 2 seconds is a bad user experience and Google will not give that page favourable treatment. Google has an online tool to check speed. 

Mobile friendly simply means that the page delivers a good user experience on mobile devices. Great design, images and videos the correct size, easy to use interface, easy to navigate‚Ä¶ you get the idea. Google crawls and indexes using mobile, and it renders the page - meaning it can ‚Äòsee‚Äô the page and so it easily understands when a page isn‚Äôt mobile friendly. Google has an online tool that allows you to see how it perceives the page. 

Blocks are VERY VERY important. Google analyses the web at block-level. So you need to organise your content in blocks. Cindy Krum talks about Fraggles. Fraggles are fragments of content, each with a handle. The handle is a div, or a semantic HTML5 element. The idea is that Google identifies a block of content that answers its user‚Äôs query, then reaches into the content and uses the handle to pull that segment (or block) up and place it in the SERP. Organising your content in Fraggles makes Google's life much easier. 

Schema markup is incredibly important.
Schema markup indicates to Google which parts of the content it should use for which use-cases. A good example is FAQ markup that helps Google identify questions and answers and that facilitates their delivery on the SERP in the form of Featured Snippets and People Also Ask. 
Google also uses schema markup to make sure it has understood your content. Add schema markup to your content as much as you can to make your content as clear as possible to Google. 
Google has an online tool to check your schema markup."
Explanation of the Simple Non Technical SEO Techniques You Can Use for Brand SERP Optimisation	"There is an ENORMOUS amount you can do beyond technical. In fact, SEO in general, and Brand SERPs in particular today rely MUCH more on non-technical than on technical, which wasn‚Äôt the case in the noughties. 

Your major levers here are: internal linking, multimedia content, digestible copywriting, communicating entities and relationships, freshness,  corroboration, inbound links, mentions, credibility  and user generated content. These aspects are covered in the lessons in different courses as and when they are necessary. For the moment, a quick overview.

Internal linking - make sure your internal linking is logical and clear. You need to use internal linking to signpost the content you think is important and relevant to users who are searching your brand. 

Multimedia content - add quality content. Focus on images, audio and video because that is what Google‚Äôs users, and therefore Google, are looking for. Make sure that your content is on topic‚Ä¶ content that your audience will find relevant and interesting. You need to optimize your images and your videos.  

Make sure you've got descriptive alt tags on your images and that that the filename also describes the image. For both, use the figure html tag - using the figure tag, you have explicitly identified a Fraggle - a fragment of content with a handle. So Google can easily reach in, grab the fragment by its handle and put the image or video in the SERP

Simplify your writing style. 
Make sure your writing is clear and concise so that it is easier for Google to understand. But a simpler writing style is also very often better for people. So with clear and concise writing you are winning on two fronts.

Whatever the content format, whether writing, podcasting, images or videos‚Ä¶ Make sure that the content makes sense out of context. Imagine the content as a block in the SERP. Does it make sense as standalone content? Does it make sense to someone who doesn‚Äôt know your brand as well as you do ? 

A lot of brands write content with an inside view. They forget that the people consuming this content are looking at the brand from the outside and imagine that the audience knows more about the brand than they do in reality. That makes the content difficult to digest for the audience. Especially on the SERP.

So when creating content be empathetic and create content that  addresses the topic from the user‚Äôs point of view - les ‚ÄòI me mine‚Äô, and more ‚Äòyou and we‚Äô, as it were.

Entities and Relationships
With Hummingbird, Google moved from strings to things, meaning it attempts to understand the world in a manner similar to the human brain.  It analyses entities and understands them through their relationship to other entities. 

So, for Google to understand your content, it is very important to include entities and relationships. You can do that by using semantic triples. ‚ÄúSemantic triples‚Äù sounds very complicated, but it's actually very simple - subject verb object. 

The subject is an entity. The verb is the relationship and the object is another entity. Keep subject verb and object as close together as possible in your sentences. And make sure that the verb you use describes the relationship clearly and unambiguously. 

‚ÄúAdidas make shoes‚Äù - subject, verb, object - is easier for Google to understand  than ‚ÄúAdidas, the german shoe manufacturer‚Äù or ‚ÄúAdidas, the German company, has a long history in shoe-making‚Äù.

With accurate semantic triples in your content writing, you are making things MUCH clearer for Google, and giving yourself  a BIG helping hand.

Your content needs to be fresh
Add new content regularly. Not necessarily every day or even every week. But whatever rhythm you choose, stick to it. Not only does this encourage Google, but it looks better to your audience - on your site, on social platforms and on your Brand SERP. 

Some content you create will be evergreen. Even in that case, updating it from time to time is a good idea. Keep it up-to-date for users and fresh for Google. Schema markup is very helpful here - it includes a lastModified tag that indicates explicitly to Google when you last updated the content and that makes it easy for Google to see you are on the ball.

Corroboration
Any information you give about your brand that you want to push up onto your Brand SERP needs corroboration from multiple third parties. That corroboration can be from any relevant trustworthy source - a relevant industry organisation, a local association, a government organisation, a social media platform, a client, a supplier, a journalist, a blogger‚Ä¶ or in a knowledge base such as Wikidata or Crunchbase. Wikipedia is obviously the pinnacle, but it is not necessary for most brands, so don‚Äôt get hung up on Wikipedia.

Links and mentions 
Getting a relevant link to a piece of content is a big, big win. One quality link can boost a piece of content onto your Brand SERP from nowhere. So keep getting those links - encourage others to link to the content you want to rank on your Brand SERP since a link from a relevant source is a very strong indication that your content is relevant and important to people who are searching for your brand. 

But also get mentions. With or without the link, mentions of your brand in a relevant context helps Google understand who you are and what you do, but also sends a strong signal to Google that your brand is noteworthy within your industry.

Links and mentions play into credibility
And credibility is incredibly important to your SEO, and absolutely essential for your Brand SERPs. Google refers to credibility as E-A-T - Expertise Authority and Trust. 

Expertise - Is the information accurate? Is this writer or brand credible writing about this topic?
Authoritativeness - Is the author well-respected in their field? Is the brand widely recognized in the industry? Is the content referred to elsewhere on the web by other authoritative websites, brands, and people?
Trustworthiness - Do the brand and the writer have a good reputation and is the content reliable? 

Importantly, they are judging credibility or E-A-T at three levels - the content, the author, and the website. 

Next, encourage and include user generated content as much as possible.
Reviews and user comments are very powerful. Both reviews and comments add context, provide additional information around the content and give a strong indication that the content is valuable and relevant for your audience
Reviews have the added advantage that they actually send an explicit quality signal.

And Social media
Make sure you have a solid presence on social. Choose the platforms that are most popular with your audience and join them there. Bring value to your audience on each platform and get engagement. Sharing on social platforms, and the general social buzz around your content is a signal to Google that the content is useful and appreciated. 

A quick word on relevancy and value...
These are BOTH phenomenally important for Brand SERPs. Google aims to fill your Brand SERP with the content that is the most relevant and most valuable to your audience. 

The content you should focus on for your SEO strategy is content that is relevant and valuable to your users. This is vital, particularly in your Brand SERP where those are the single most important criteria Google is using to rank.

Importantly, stay on topic. 
Don't be tempted to spread the net and try and hit every topic on earth. Stick to your brand, your products, the solutions you provide, and topics your audience is interested in. 
Be relevant. Provide valuable content. Stay on topic. 

Conclusion?
Gone are the days when you could succeed in SEO with just one tactic. In the past, low-quality content could rank by having boatloads of backlinks, and well-optimised content could rank with few backlinks. It was a tactics-based game.

As you have probably realised, SEO is not standalone. It is necessarily just one cog in your overall marketing strategy. In Brand SERPs, this is especially true. Google uses content from many sources in your Brand SERP - your site, social, media sites, its own knowledge graph, and many more‚Ä¶
To evaluate the value any given piece of content brings to your audience, and therefore to choose WHICH content to show, Google depends on signals from across your entire digital ecosystem.

What is your digital ecosystem? 
Your site, your social platforms, mentions of your brand, the content you create, the content you distribute, the behaviour of your audience, third party statements about you, trust signals ‚Ä¶ in short, EVERYTHING you do online affects your digital ecosystem, and Google is watching that very very closely - quality, quantity and scope.  

Today, and especially in the context of Brand SERPs, you need a well-balanced strategy that includes a solid technical foundation, content that is valuable to your audience, engagement and a demonstrable reputation in the form of Expertise Authority and Trust. 

Your Brand SERP reflects Google‚Äôs view of your digital ecosystem and highlights the strengths and weaknesses of your marketing strategy. Look at what Google shows for your brand and you will better understand your digital ecosystem and where you are with your marketing strategy. There will be MUCH more about that, and in fact everything I have talked about here, in other lessons."
Explanation of the Strategies to Avoid for Brand SERP Optimisation - Algorithmic	"Your Brand SERP is a reflection of Google‚Äôs opinion of you. There is a BIG spotlight on it at all times. More than anywhere else in SEO, when you cheat on your Brand SERP, you are cheating in full and open view.

 In many situations, cheating, spamming, black hat and shortcuts means taking a calculated risk, which is fine. But in the post Hummingbird world, taking a risk with your brand name is not a good idea. Now that Google understands entities, as and when you do get caught, it is increasingly difficult to leave that bad mark behind you. Google knows who you are. It doesn‚Äôt forget.

If you start start using cheat-y shortcuts then you are sending a signal to Google that you are not to be trusted. Google might not see the cheating today. But it will. And when it does, your reputation in its eyes will suck. And because it understands entities, it understands who you are, and it won‚Äôt forget. 

Does it hold grudges? I have been told by ex-Googlers that it didn‚Äôt hold grudges for manual penalties in the past. Given how things have moved forwards over the last years, and given entity based search, even if it doesn‚Äôt hold grudges, and bad reputation WILL follow you for the rest of your internet life. 

The great thing about Brand SERPs is that they hit right to the core of Google‚Äôs opinion of you. That is why this course is so important for every brand. If the Brand SERP looks great, then things are going well, and the world is all roses. 

But then the flip side is very dark. Cheating on your Brand SERP is playing with fire on your reputation with Google. Don‚Äôt do it - it could well derail your entire SEO strategy.

Black Hat
Black hat can work in some circumstances, but on Brand SERPs, it's really not something to do for many reasons. Principally because any black hat actions you take is then attached to your brand directly and your brand is your biggest asset. 

Don't buy links. 
PBNs are dangerous. As a consultant, I can spot these within minutes. Literally.

 In an interview on my podcast, Jim Boykin gives some great examples of how he does it. And finally, Gary Illyes has talked about how easy it is for Google to spot these, even from a very small seed set. 

And even in the unlikely case that you fly under the radar with the PBN you are using today, it will come to the surface at some point. And that black mark will be held against the entity that is your brand. You won‚Äôt be able to escape it. 

Don't buy engagement. 
Harder for Google to identify than a PBN, but still a dangerous game to play mid to long term. Once again, you are playing with your brand‚Äôs good name. You might get away with it. But what happens if you don‚Äôt? You have put your entire SEO strategy on the line.

Don‚Äôt by services that sell cheap links
Whatever the seller tells you, the links are not going to be seen as natural, they won‚Äôt bring value. On the contrary, they will damage your reputation with Google. Cheap links are spammy - they will be irrelevant links on such as forum threads, blog comments, directory links ‚Ä¶ usually on crappy sites that send no value. Ot they‚Äôll be links from a PBN. In either case, it won‚Äôt work in the short term, and will damage you mid and long term.

Risk-free short cuts don‚Äôt exist in Brand SERP management
In short, a reliable shortcut quick fix for a Brand SERP simply does not exist. It will catch up with you sooner or later, maybe five years down the line, but it will damage your brand because your brand is incredibly directly linked to your Brand SERP.

Here's an extreme example. Google hit this site with a sitewide penalty because they had bought backlinks five years ago and had not cleaned them up properly.

The penalty was so strong and so effective that their homepage didn‚Äôt even appear for a search on their own exact match brand name. They lost the one search position every brand should have‚Ä¶ top spot for their own brand name.

Imagine how damaging that was, whether it's clients, prospective clients, journalists, whoever. They could not find the brand when they searched for it. You don't want that to happen to you.

So it will blow up in your face today, tomorrow, three years down the line, five years down the line, but it almost certainly will explode. I was talking to John Mueller and he said ‚Äúpeople cheat - they look for the quick fix. Always will. We allow them to cheat initially. We leave the gates open and we let people get away with it. Why? Because that allows us to collect the data to figure out what they're doing. Then we close the Gates once we figured it out.‚Äù

Now, closing the gates could be as small as simply making the spam irrelevant by excluding that data algorithmically‚Ä¶ but it could also mean applying a penalty. In the case of cheating on your Brand SERP, that could mean a penalty on your entire brand in Google. That would kill your SEO strategy dead.

So, just because something is working today doesn't mean to say it will work tomorrow. It probably won't because Google will gather that data and it will figure it out and they will slap you with a penalty. Perhaps a penalty so strong that it kills your own homepage on your own Brand SERP.

How Google spots the cheating

With all these cheating tactics one thing to bear in mind is patterns.
All of them leave a footprint. A pattern. If there's one thing a machine can see very easily, it's a pattern. And if there's one thing that we as humans cannot make is chaos. The people you work with will not be able to hide their footprint and the machine will catch you sooner or later. 

Once Google HAS caught you, what happens?

Shifting the blame
With Penguin and Panda, Google made it very clear that you can‚Äôt shift the blame. Website owners who told Google ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know that the company was doing something naughty‚Äù did not have their penalties lifted. That argument simply does not wash. And if you were in Google‚Äôs shoes, you wouldn‚Äôt accept such a childish excuse either, I am sure.  

Cleaning Up
Eventually, then, you will have to clean up the black hat mess you made. And cleaning up black hat is more costly than setting it up.
If you've ever heard about - or been hit by - these penalties (maybe Panda or Penguin) you will know that actually getting that spam out there is quite cheap. But cleaning it up isn‚Äôt. 

And there‚Äôs a delightfully ironic trap to cleaning up the mess‚Ä¶ Annoyingly, the easiest, simplest and least expensive way to clean up is to pay the same company that put the spam out there to remove it all. I‚Äôve seen this happen many times. Paying a company to spam, then paying them again to clean it up.

Second. Trying to drown negative results

Drowning with cheap, purpose-built new content
This is the typical ‚Äúquick fix‚Äù offered when a Brand SERP contains some negative content. Firstly, bear in mind that if a negative article is ranking, then Google deems it important. You really should look at WHY Google seems it to be important. Is it because it is accurate?

Beware of any company offering to create CHEAP content to drown. Whether they tell you this or not, they are doing something that is against Google‚Äôs guidelines, and is therefore a great candidate for a penalty sooner or later. 

Worse still, on brand SERps these tactics very rarely work. These articles very very rarely rank page 1 on your Brand SERP because they bring no value to your audience. Cheap brand-centric content won‚Äôt rank, so you are wasting your money, time and potentially ruining your reputation. 

Creating all these articles that have no use for anybody is creating more spam, and that's one of Google's big problems. Think about why Google created Panda. The reason they brought in Panda is because people were creating junk content and the web was filling up with junk. Back in 2011 there was a phenomenal amount of junk content, and that posed a problem for Google, but also for users. 

With spammy articles, you're hitting that Panda button again. That isn‚Äôt a good button to press - Panda-style penalties are pretty radical !

Also consider your audience here
In the unlikely case that one of these spammy articles does rank, then having this type of article on your Brand SERP damages your reputation in the eyes of your audience This type of content usually jumps out as fake to humans. What do they think of you when they see it? 

If content that looks spammy to a human ranks on your Brand SERP, does that reflect well on your brand image? So even if you DO manage to trick Google for a while, ask yourself if you are doing your reputation in the eyes of your own human audience. Almost certainly not."
Explanation of the PR Strategies that Will Have a Negative Effect on Brand SERP Optimisation	"Negative SEO
Don't do negative SEO to remove negative results. It is very difficult to do without leaving an identifiable footprint and it is very very risky. Don't attack the person who is writing bad things about you because you'll do it badly and you‚Äôll probably get caught either by the person you're attacking or by Google. It really is playing with fire and can easily blow up in your face.

If the website owner catches you, they will react badly. Possibly VERY badly. Since they already rank, then they are a) good at SEO and b) in a very good position to make things worse. They could simply make the m√©tas more damaging. Or work to push the result even further up your SERP.

We have a course that will teach you how to drown negative content effectively and in a manner that retains your good name - it‚Äôs all about leapfrogging the bad content with great content that is ranked just below. Another helpful trick is triggering rich elements such as video boxes and Twitter boxes and killing a blue link, thus pushing the bad result down. There‚Äôs a whole course about that too.

Court cases
Calling your lawyers is unlikely to be an effective solution. You need to weigh up the pros and cons.
It takes years to get through the courts, it costs a fortune and rarely directly changes the situation. So it rarely has the effect you want. Even when you are in the right. And almost never in the short term.

Firstly, ask yourself ‚Äúis the person expressing an opinion‚Äù. If yes, then they have every right, and lawyers won‚Äôt change that. Free speech means that you can say what you think of others. And so can they. Even if you think they are wrong or unfair, they have the right to say it.

Secondly ‚Äúare they in the wrong‚Äù. If yes, then you will theoretically win a court case. But then you need to weigh up, how long will it take, how much will it cost, and will you be able to force the site to comply with the judgement. 

Answers there : years, a fortune, probably not. 

Quick note on competitors ‚Äòattacking‚Äô you - they probably know what they are doing. They have probably balanced the pros and cons - short term gains outweigh long term consequences. Perhaps ‚ÄòI lose the case in the long term, but by then it won‚Äôt matter, since I‚Äôll have won the war‚Äô.

Here‚Äôs the scenarios :
1 - Best case is that the site owner gets scared and does what you ask. That is VERY VERY rare. Let‚Äôs say 1% (I have no idea if that is the correct figure, but I have NEVER seen any site give up this easily, even when they are in the wrong)

2 - Next best is that you go through the court case, and after 3 years, you win. Can you execute the judgement? Perhaps you will get a payment. But can you actually have them remove the content you object to? If the legal entity is under the same jurisdiction as yours. Maybe. If not, then you can almost certainly forget it.

3 - They appeal. You have another few years in court, with costs‚Ä¶ And back to point 1.

4 - You lose. And you have spent time and money and got nowhere.

In all of these cases, that result has been sitting on your SERP damaging your business for several years, you have spent boatloads of money on lawyers, not to mention your precious time getting the case ready‚Ä¶ all for perhaps a 2% chance of actually succeeding.

The chances of winning are made particularly slim because 
1 - law changes slowly, the internet moves fast. So the texts of law are years and years behind the current needs. In short, the legal system is absolutely not adapted or ready to deal with the issues the internet is throwing up. 

2 - Few lawyers are qualified or capable in this domain. Understanding law, and understanding the internet are not mutually exclusive, but the number of lawyers who truly understand both is very very limited. So you are unlikely to even find a lawyer who understands the problem you are trying to deal with, let alone be able to argue it in court within a legal system that is not designed for this problem. But they will, of course, take the case, and your money.

3 - judges and magistrates understand the internet even less than the lawyers. 

All that adds up to a bit of a lottery. And a slow lottery.
I don‚Äôt say ‚Äúnever go to court‚Äù. I say, think carefully. And if you do choose to take the legal route, with the techniques in these courses to improve your Brand SERP. That bad result will probably have disappeared off page #1 before the court adjourns :) 

Watch out for Firestorms - The Streisand effect.
Win or lose a court case, you run the risk of triggering the  Streisand Effect. It's pretty scary. It is named after Barbara Streisand. In 2003 she brought a court case to stop a photographer using his photos of her Malibu home. She took him to court with the aim of suppressing the photos. She was in the right, and eventually won the case.

However, it turns out that the court case had the exact opposite effect that she was looking for. The court case lasted several months‚Ä¶ and got wide media coverage. You can guess what happened. During the court case, these very boring photos that had interested very few people went viral on the internet. So, by the time the photographer complied with the court ruling and deleted his copies of the photos, the problem was both elsewhere and MUCH MUCH bigger than the initial issue. The photos had been reproduced millions of times by other people and NOBODY had any control.  

In short, by bringing legal action, Barbera‚Äôs initial aim of suppressing the photos and making sure that nobody saw them actually triggered the exact opposite. A few throwaway photos that nobody was initially interested in became the talk of the celebrity world‚Ä¶ but worse still, she attracted a BOATLOAD of negative press about herself around her court case.

Here's the Wikipedia entry that tells us how the name came about, which is quite a fun story. I'll let you read that. 

The Streisand Effect is a good lesson for many shortcut tactics - The more you try to suppress something, the more human beings are encouraged to look for it, and amplify it... and the worse the problem gets.

Probably not as bad as this one for Barbera‚Ä¶  now she has a phenomenen named after her, this story is told over and over again 17 years later. This REALLY flipped on her.

Something more positive on legal stuff
If the content falls under the European ‚ÄúRight to be forgotten‚Äù laws, then use that instead as ask Google to remove the result from its results. Just remember that this only covers countries in the EU, so the problem isn‚Äôt solved everywhere. Depending on the countries your market cover that may or may not be a problem.

And that leads us neatly onto the fact that we are playing Google‚Äôs game‚Äôs game, so we have to play by Google‚Äôs rules

The people Googling your brand name are Google‚Äôs users, on Google‚Äôs website, so Google sets the rules of the game. It's Google's game 100% right down the line. If your audience uses Google, as far as your Brand SERP is concerned, you HAVE no choice to play Google's game by Google‚Äôs rules. You don't get to pick and choose. Or even complain.

People Googling your brand name are your audience. But they are also Google‚Äôs users. And it wants to show those users an honest appraisal of your brand.

 It doesn't make up opinions. It‚Äôs reflecting the world's opinion of you. Google is simply reflecting the world‚Äôs opinion of your brand. It ranks the results on your Brand SERP by order of value to the person searching your name. 

So if it's ranking something you don‚Äôt agree with, perhaps something negative, it thinks it is relevant and important information that it wants to share with its users‚Ä¶ if you want it to show something else, it's up to you to prove that another piece of content is more valuable, more important and more relevant.
In most cases your opinion about what content is most valuable, relevant and important will probably not be quite the same as Google. You need to convince. Prove.

This series of courses is all about how to play Google‚Äôs game by Google‚Äôs rules... and win for your Brand SERP.

Two things to conclude this lesson. Your brand is your biggest asset. You can‚Äôt escape your past. 
Your brand is your biggest asset
Remember also that your brand is precious. Your brand is an entity. Your brand is a thing. Google understands who you are. It doesn't look at your website. Your website is simply a representation of your brand. It's your brand that holds all the value, not the website.
 
It has always been the case that, faced with your audience, your brand is the most valuable asset. That is now also true with Google. Your brand reputation is your biggest asset in SEO. It is the principal driver of your SEO strategy, so it‚Äôs important to remember that...

You can‚Äôt escape your past
Remember that in a Hummingbird world, we're talking about things not strings. Your brand is a thing. It's something Google recognizes. It's an entity. So everything you do, good or bad, is attached to your brand. Any cheating that doesn‚Äôt manage to stay under the radar will be attached to your brand, and your brand will have a black mark against it. Forever. 

Your reputation is precious and is not something that has an easy fix. Your brand has a reputation that sticks over time. A bad reputation sticks, a good reputation sticks, and a good reputation is much harder to build up than a bad reputation is to win by doing something spammy or black hat. Don't create spammy articles to drown if you want to drown the content.

Back in 2009 you could cheat, then change your website when you got caught. Now that your brand is an entity, and that you are an entity, that is no longer the case. You can't run away from your past. And Google is watching all the time. It has the search and crawling history all the way back to 1998.Your history. Your audience‚Äôs history‚Ä¶ It's watching you now‚Ä¶ it has been watching you and recording ever since you first appeared online. It stores. It remembers.  So if you start cheating, it will follow you around for the rest of your life.

Don‚Äôt cheat on your Brand SERP. Your Brand SERP is a direct reflection of your brand reputation and cheating on your Brand SERP is an attempt to manipulate your reputation. Manipulate your E-A-T.

Google has shown in the past how much it hates people manipulating its algorithms. Manipulating its opinion of your brand through cheating on your Brand SERP is a very very risky tactic.

Avoid the tactics I set out here. Avoid the mistakes I set out here so that you keep your reputation intact, retain ALL the value of your most valuable asset and make sure that your future is bright. 
Thank you."
Introduction to a Basic SEO Course	"My name is Jason Barnard, and I‚Äôm the Brand SERP Guy. That‚Äôs my nickname because I specialize in Brand SERP optimization and Knowledge Panel management. Those are quite advanced topics so I won‚Äôt be covering them in this course. But if you‚Äôre curious, just search ‚ÄúBrand SERP‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Brand SERP Guy‚Äù on Google and you‚Äôll find boatloads of information on those topics!

I‚Äôve been working in SEO since 1998 - which is the year Google was incorporated - so I‚Äôve ‚Äúseen it all‚Äù, as they say :) During the next 40+ lessons, I‚Äôll be introducing you to the wonderful world of SEO. I‚Äôve been fascinated with search engines, and how to optimise for them for well over 20 years‚Ä¶ and my passion for SEO is HIGHLY unlikely to waver any time in the NEXT 20 years :)

Whether you are a budding entrepreneur, a marketer who runs a one-man show or an SEO-guru wannabe, this course will teach the necessary basics to start using the power of SEO for shaping the SERP. A skillful SEO expert can drive plenty of targeted traffic to a website, but as with all great things in life, be aware that you‚Äôll need to put in a lot of time and effort. 

Over the course of the modules and lessons, you‚Äôll learn what happens behind the scenes when you enter a search query into Google‚Äôs search bar, and what it takes to push a website to the top of the search results. By the time you get to the end of the course, you‚Äôll know what it takes to create a website, which page elements matter for SEO, and what kind of content is considered quality. 

You‚Äôll also understand why every SEO strategy starts with keyword research, and the role backlinks play in organic promotion. I‚Äôll also dive into the tech details so that you can be on the same page as web developers. 
Finally, you‚Äôll learn how to analyze the results you achieve and adjust your SEO strategy based on real life data and information. 

At the end of each lesson, you‚Äôll need to take a short test to check you understand the contents of that lesson. Then, when you complete the course and successfully pass the final test, you‚Äôll get a certificate that shows you have a solid foundation in SEO."
Explanation of What is SEO and Why it is Important	"Previously you learned about the basics of digital marketing, what a search engine is, and how it works. And today, I‚Äôll get to the main topic of our course‚ÄîSearch Engine Optimization, or SEO. Before I teach you how SEO works and how to do it, let‚Äôs first go over the basics of SEO, then we can dive into the benefits of website optimization, what it consists of and when you should optimise your website. 
Before starting, let‚Äôs look at what a user is doing when they submit a search query in Google... They are looking for the solution to a problem or the answer to a question. And they are asking Google to provide the best solution. Obviously you want Google to present your web page as the best solution to its user‚Äôs problem.
So, SEO is the art and science of persuading search engines such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo, to recommend your content to their users as the best solution to their problem. 
Now, What does a user see after submitting a search query on Google? They see advertisements, images, videos, and aside from that‚Äîa list of about 10 sites on each page.
Display the text: 
SERP ‚Äî Search Engine Results Page
When we see the first search engine results page (or SERP) we click on one of the options and go to the selected website. As a rule, we are more likely to click on results at the top of the page without going through the rest of the websites. Thus, the top 10 search results on that first page get the lion‚Äôs share of traffic.
How can you make YOUR website appear on the first page of the results? That is what SEO (or search engine optimization)  is for :)
Display the text: 
SEO ‚Äî Search Engine Optimization
To understand how optimization works, you need to know how search engines select resources from a variety of similar pages and how they determine your rank. And, of course, you need to be able to apply this knowledge correctly. 
Why is SEO important?
So why is SEO so very important?
The main benefit of SEO is getting free traffic from Google as opposed to paid traffic. This free traffic is also referred to as organic or natural search traffic.
Importantly, the websites that don‚Äôt have a small ‚Äúad‚Äù badge at the top left of their listing on Google‚Äôs SERP usually get more traffic and conversions.
That‚Äôs why the goal of SEO is to make the site visible to users in the natural, not-paid-for results for a given search query.
Traffic is affected by various factors: the popularity of goods and services, the size of the region, and many others. But all other things being equal, websites that rank higher on Google will almost certainly get more traffic.

Note that search engines are focused on their own users, and they aim at providing those users with the best possible experience. So, to determine which page will appear on the first page of the search results, Google considers not only the relevance of the webpage to the search query, but also many other factors that will help make the experience of Google‚Äôs users on Google‚Äôs search results as positive and rewarding as possible. 
Each search engine has its own algorithms to evaluate and rank websites. These algorithms include multiple metrics and are constantly updated, making it impossible for webmasters to attain and maintain high rankings without keeping up to date with emerging trends and changes. By keeping your ear to the ground and understanding how the search engine algorithms are evolving, it is possible for you to understand what you can usefully do to maximise your chances of ranking top and staying there by adjusting your site and SEO strategies accordingly. 
For now, let‚Äôs single out several of the most important ranking algorithms.
Display the highlighted text below:

So, the most important SEO ranking factors are:
content relevance to the query
website credibility in Google‚Äôs eyes 
Then, the speaker says the following:
These are:
Content Relevance, which stands for how well the information on a webpage corresponds to a search query.
and credibility, which measures how well your site meets the recommendations of search engines and how well it‚Äôs likely to perform in search results.
High credibility is a green light for search engines. Generally, this term refers to a combination of internal and external criteria: for example, how fast your site loads, how well it works on mobile devices, how many quality backlinks you have, and many, many others. 
We will discuss all the most popular factors that affect ranking in detail in the following lessons.
The benefits of SEO
That‚Äôs all for the SEO basics. Let‚Äôs now move on to the benefits of search engine optimization.
So, what ARE the benefits of SEO?
Display the yellow text
Top SEO Benefits:
great visibility
organic traffic
long-term results
better website quality
(the speaker explains the text on the screen)
The first advantage is great visibility.
The better your website is optimized, the better visibility it has in search results and the more your potential customers will see it.

Another plus is organic traffic.
Here is a delightful ‚Äúgolden rule‚Äù: first, you work for SEO, then SEO works for you.
Just like with other digital marketing channels, SEO can be expensive and time-consuming. But when you do everything right, all the efforts will eventually pay off and the website will start receiving natural, organic traffic.
The next advantage is that SEO gets long-term results.
When you get your site to the top, you still have to maintain and improve it. However, the advantage of working with SEO as opposed to using PPC ads is that you will continue to get traffic to your website long term with very little investment necessary. 
And the last benefit is better website quality.
Google, Bing, and Yahoo take into account tens of thousands of factors and weight them based on the overall importance of each to SEO. But remember, the aim of these search engines is to best serve their users. So their algorithms are built with the aim of promoting websites, web pages and content that best serves the user. Therefore, by improving your website for search engines, you are actually improving it for the users as well. High-quality content, crawlability and speed, adaptability for different types of devices, on page user experience‚Äîare all components of the best SEO practices.
As you can see, search engine optimization is one of the most important and effective traffic channels, and also a strategy that helps you improve the experience for your own users too :)

But. It is important to bear in mind that it is not a magic bullet and not a one-size-fits-all solution for all websites.
When to use SEO?
So, when should you use SEO techniques?
SEO is a long term game. Getting to the first page of the search engine results won‚Äôt happen overnight or even in a week. If you are planning to maintain your website for a long time and are sure that your products and services will continue to be relevant in the months and years to come, then you can use SEO. 
On the other hand, there are situations when it‚Äôs better not to invest in SEO and use other channels instead. For example:
If you want to launch temporary projects such as a specific event or a flash sale on a product you stock only temporarily;
or if you want to test new products or launch a startup company;  
and finally, don‚Äôt opt for SEO if you have a tight deadline and an obligation to quickly  generate traffic to your website.
In these cases, it is better to use channels that will bring traffic in the short term, like Google Ads or social media campaigns.
What are the components of SEO?
We‚Äôve learned when to use SEO. Now, let‚Äôs look at its main components.
We often separate SEO into two parts: on-page and off-page optimization. As the name suggests, on-page SEO is all about improving the website from the inside, and off-page SEO comes down to working with external resources such as getting backlinks to your website.
Let's take a closer look at on-page SEO.
First of all, on-site SEO is about your website performance. So it‚Äôs crucial for webmasters to consider image file sizes on their pages, reduce redirects, improve the mobile responsiveness of their site, and minimize the amount of CSS/Javascript.
The second component is content quality and structure. Make sure that the content on your pages is relevant and engaging for your audience, contains the search terms they actually use, as well as quality, relevant images and videos.
Other components include internal linking, title tags, meta descriptions, alt texts, etc.
Now off-page SEO.
There are many, many strategies for off-page SEO such as Social Media Marketing, Third Party Reviews, Brand marketing, etc. which I will discuss in future lessons. But one of the core strategies you should be aware of for off-page SEO is maintaining a well-structured backlink profile, which means getting relevant, authoritative sites to link to your site. Search engines analyze the quality and number of backlinks pointing to your site which positively impacts the credibility of your content, your website and your brand which helps boost your rankings.
Now, a quick conclusion for this lesson: SEO is one of the main and the most effective digital marketing channels to promote your website and sell your products or services. Once you figure out how to apply your knowledge, you‚Äôll be well on your way to earning first results‚Äîranking higher, getting more traffic and, hopefully increasing sales. 
That‚Äôs all for today. I hope you‚Äôve learned a few things about SEO and are ready to move on to the next lesson, where I‚Äôll take a closer look at how search engines see and understand your website."
Explanation of Tips and Trick fro Web Hosting For SEO	"Anatomy of a website‚Äôs address
As you are aware, each site has its own unique address that sets it apart from others. Let‚Äôs take a moment to dissect what goes into a website‚Äôs address. 

For example, you are all familiar with ‚Äògoogle.com‚Äô, which has two parts. First, its name ‚Äògoogle‚Äô, and second ‚Äò.com‚Äô. The .com is known as an extension or Top Level Domain, or TLD.

Originally the main role for the TLD was to associate websites with a particular purpose. 

The text is displayed on the screen:

.—Åom ‚Äî Commercial companies
.org ‚Äî Nonprofit organizations
.net ‚Äî Network organizations

 

TLDs were designed to be a way to classify websites and define their purpose. The .com suffix was meant for business websites, while .org was reserved for nonprofits and charities. Network organizations were supposed to use the .net suffix. 

But people didn‚Äôt respect that idea and it all got mixed up pretty quickly: nonprofit websites using the .com suffix or, say, a magazine website with the .net suffix. The only restrictions that survived are the ones where the rules are enforced: extensions such as .gov for governments  or .edu for educational institutions.

Now there‚Äôs a wide variety of TLDs that aim to communicate the purpose of the website. They can be anything from .design to .guru, and everything in between. Yet, the old .com TLD remains the most used and popular.

Another group of traditional TLDs communicates the location of a website or the market it targets. 

The text is displayed on the screen:

UK ‚Äî United Kingdom
FR ‚Äî France
US ‚Äî United States

 

Those TLDs use country codes. For example, .uk stands for the United Kingdom, .fr stands for France, and .us, for the United States. These are great if your market is restricted to a specific country.

If we compare website names to physical addresses, TLDs would be streets. The remaining part of the website name, which goes before the ‚Äúdot‚Äù sign, would be the house number. 

The text is displayed on the screen:


google.com = house_number.street
 

In this example, .com is the street, and ‚Äúgoogle‚Äù is the house number. 

The part that goes before the dot is called a domain name. There are no two websites under the same TLD with identical domain names, just as there are no two houses on the same street with identical numbers. So, the combination of a domain name and TLD makes a unique address for a website on the Internet.
How to choose a domain name?
Choosing a domain name can be hard. But it‚Äôs one of the most important decisions you‚Äôll ever make. Your domain name is one of the first things people see and will influence people‚Äôs first impression of your site. 

You can use a keyword that explains what your website is about. Or you can use your brand name to stand out from similar websites in your niche. Whatever your naming strategy is, make sure your domain name is clear and memorable.

Before you register a domain name, make sure you follow the three main rules:

The text is displayed on the screen:

The domain name is available
It uses the Latin alphabet
It obeys the law and looks credible

  

First, you can‚Äôt register a domain name identical to one that‚Äôs already in use by another website. If the domain name you want isn‚Äôt available, you can consider another TLD or come up with an alternative one.

Second, although registrars support non-Latin characters and have no restrictions for using numbers and dashes, hold off on adding them to your domain name. Using any symbols other than Latin letters can undermine the readability and memorability of your website.

Finally, don‚Äôt use another businesses‚Äô brand names or trademarks to avoid legal action and suspension of your domain. Remember that your domain name should look credible and should not follow patterns used by phishing and malware websites, for example, don‚Äôt try to be clever with misspellings.

You are looking for three ‚ÄúC‚Äôs‚Äù: Clear, credible, and communicative

What is web hosting?

When I talked about website domain names, I made an analogy with a physical address of a house. And now I‚Äôm going to extend the analogy between houses and sites to fit web hosting into the picture and explain what it is and what you need it for.

The physical address is all you need to locate a particular house in a city. Now, let‚Äôs shift attention from the house to the land where it stands. You need hosting just as you‚Äôd need land to build a house on. 

When you pay for hosting services, you are renting some storage space from a hosting provider. After you set up your hosting, the host‚Äôs server will store your website‚Äôs code making your site publicly accessible to users on the Internet.
How to buy a domain name and web hosting?
Now we are getting to the most exciting part of the topic‚Äîbuying a domain name and web hosting.

The first thing to note is that you can purchase a domain name and a hosting package either separately or in a bundle. 

When buying them separately, you should buy a domain name from a registrar first, and find a hosting provider second. Yet, most hosts can help you with registering a domain name. If you buy a domain name from your host, you‚Äôll be able to manage your hosting and domain subscriptions in one place.

And to be clear, although I say ‚Äòbuy‚Äù it is actually ‚Äúrent‚Äù - you pay hosting on a monthly or yearly basis. If you don‚Äôt pay, your site will no longer be available to users on the Internet. For the domain, you pay a yearly rental fee. If you don‚Äôt pay the rental fee, your site will no longer be available at that address, and someone else could take over. So be sure to always pay your rent on time :)

In any case, you need to decide on the domain name in advance, to avoid unnecessary delays and complications when ordering hosting services. For this, you can check the availability of your desired domain names using domain name search tools.

Importantly, to get started with the right hosting package for your needs, you need to put together a list of your technical requirements first. Those can include, server load capacity, disk space, database type, and supported programming languages, to name a few. 

It may sound complex but don‚Äôt worry. If you‚Äôre launching a large site, you should consult with your web developers before choosing the hosting package. They know all the technical specifications and will help you with the details. If you‚Äôre building a small site yourself, the cheaper hosting plans will likely work for you just fine. 

Some platforms offer both site-building tools together with hosting services. If you decide to create a site using a site builder, like Wix or Shopify, you won‚Äôt have to worry about choosing the right web hosting at all. Those platforms provide hosting services and include them in the subscription price.

I‚Äôve mentioned a few, but I‚Äôm not going to recommend any particular web hosting provider. Instead, I suggest consulting with your developers or checking some online guides and reviews to find a host that offers the best services for your needs.

After you decide on the hosting provider and choose the hosting package, you‚Äôll need to commit to at least a month of hosting, but often a year. To make a purchase, you‚Äôll need to provide your domain name and contact details. Your hosting credentials and other necessary information will be sent to your email.
Connecting your domain name to your hosting account

Now, I‚Äôm going to talk through some technical details to help you better understand how the website, domain, and hosting work together.

After you purchase hosting, you‚Äôll need to connect to your host‚Äôs admin and upload your website files to the server. 
If you bought your domain name together with your hosting package, you‚Äôll set that up in the same place. But, if you bought your domain name directly from a registrar, you‚Äôll need to set that up in THEIR admin and configure the domain to point to the hosting, which isn‚Äôt as complicated as it might sound :)

Regardless of the admin panel you use, there will be a menu called Domain Management, or Domain Settings, or something along those lines. On that menu, you‚Äôll have a setting called ‚ÄúNameserver‚Äù that indicates the server that‚Äôs currently connected to your domain name. You‚Äôll need to change the server assigned by default to the one provided by your hosting provider. You‚Äôll find the relevant server name in the email confirmation you received from your hosting provider when you purchased the hosting.

As soon as you connect your domain name to your hosting account and upload your website to the server, people will be able to find it on the Internet. 

Let‚Äôs look at what happens after someone types your website‚Äôs name in the browser.

The picture is displayed on the screen:





The browser asks a DNS server whether it knows where your website is hosted - ie which hosting provider you are using for your website. The DNS server replies with your hosting server‚Äôs Internet protocol‚ÄîIP address. The browser loads then asks the hosting provider for the website content using the IP address, loads the web page into the browser window and bingo!  ... you got another visitor.

Before you move to the next lesson, I'd like to reiterate one vital thing: To keep your website running over time, because you are only renting, you‚Äôll need to renew your domain name and hosting subscriptions in a timely manner. If they expire, your website will be offline. The worst thing is to let your domain name expire because your domain name will become available for purchase on the open market - anyone can then take over your internet address, even a competitor."
Explanation of Different CMS in the Context of Search Engine optimisation	"Imagine, you need to build a house.
It‚Äôs not necessary for you to know how to lay foundations, build walls, and tile floors. You can hire professional builders to do all that for you. Similarly, you can use a CMS that automatically creates all the fundamental elements for your website.
CMS stands for Content Management System.  It‚Äôs an application that helps you create websites as well as publish, store, and manage your content. If you use a CMS to build a simple website, you won‚Äôt even need to write a single line of code.
Let‚Äôs get back to our analogy of building a house. A CMS is your construction crew. You give instructions and the CMS creates a site for you. You decide how many ‚Äúfloors‚Äù (or site category pages) and ‚Äúrooms‚Äù (or product pages) your site should have. You decide what the ‚Äúinterior‚Äù (or your website design) should look like. Then your CMS generates all the code needed to bring your ideas to life.
Types of Content Management Systems
For starters, let‚Äôs look at the different types of CMSs you can choose from.
Be they free open-source or paid-for commercial, most of the CMSs belong to one of three main types: traditional CMSs, website builders, and headless CMSs. Let‚Äôs look at each type in more detail:
Traditional CMS are off-the-shelf software applications that you can purchase or download for free and install on your hosting server. By choosing them you rely on ready-to-use solutions and templates to build websites that you can look at as an  ‚Äúindustry standard‚Äù. Some popular traditional CMSs are WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, Opencart, and Magento, to name a few.
Website builders are another common type of CMS. These are online services that help you quickly create a landing page or a simple website without writing any code or even downloading any applications. All you need to do is to sign up, choose a template‚Äîand you‚Äôre all set. The platform will host your website and provide technical support. Small businesses commonly use Wix and Tilda to create informational websites while merchants often choose Shopify and BigCommerce to launch online stores. 
And the last type of CMSs we‚Äôll talk about are Headless CMS. The first example that comes to mind is Contentful, but there are more. Headless CMSs are the most innovative and will be the most flexible. But at the same time, they‚Äôre the most complicated. With a Headless CMS, you‚Äôll definitely need a developer who‚Äôll have to write a lot of custom code and configure integrations, which can be expensive.
It makes sense to use a Headless CMS if you want to build a complex application, like those that take content from one CMS and display it across various user interfaces, from desktops through mobile to wearables (say, virtual reality headsets, for example). 
If you‚Äôre going to launch a simple business website or a small online shop, you will be better off choosing one of the first two options.
Popular CMS use cases
Let‚Äôs look closer at some of the most popular CMSs anyone can use:
We‚Äôll start with WordPress because it‚Äôs the most-used and has been a leader in the CMS market for over a decade. The CMS is open-source (so, free to use) and easy to use. WordPress offers a huge variety of templates and plugins that add functionality making it super-attractive for aspiring webmasters. Wordpress works for the smallest sites all the way through to the biggest. Even big businesses and industry leaders use Wordpress. Let‚Äôs look at a couple of successful WordPress websites.
The video is displayed on the screen showing a visitor browsing https://lifehacker.com/ and the voice-over says:
Have you read the Lifehacker website? It‚Äôs been built with WordPress. 
The video is displayed on the screen showing a visitor browsing https://blog.playstation.com/ and the voice-over says:
And PlayStation‚Äôs blog is another good example of a WordPress website. 
Shopify website builder is second by market share and popularity to WordPress, and it ranks in the leading position in the eCommerce niche. It‚Äôs a solution for those who want to launch an online store quickly - in as little as a day! Shopify offers everything that merchants need‚Äîattractive website templates, secure PCI compliant payments, and shipping integrations. And on top of all the eCommerce features, it has a built-in blogging platform.
The video is displayed on the screen showing a visitor browsing https://hiutdenim.co.uk/ and the voice-over says: 
Let‚Äôs look at the website that belongs to HIUT Denim, a denim jean factory from Hertfordshire in the UK. This pretty impressive online shop was created by the owners themselves on the Shopify platform. It has a product catalog, shopping cart and checkout page, and even shares the factory‚Äôs story in blog posts and videos.
Another popular website builder is Wix. It‚Äôs ideal for creating small websites with beautiful designs. This website builder is a solution for, say, a private practice law firm that needs a one-page site with a list of services and contact details. Also, people in creative professions often use Wix for personal blogs and portfolios.
The video is displayed on the screen showing a visitor browsing https://www.hellohannahjacobs.com/ and the voice-over says: 
Check out Hannah Jacobs‚Äô website, and you‚Äôll see that it‚Äôs absolutely possible to build a solid website without hiring programmers. Hannah Jacobs, a freelance animator and illustrator from London, built her Wix portfolio website herself, and it looks VERY good indeed! 
What a CMS can do for you
We‚Äôve looked at different types of CMSs and seen some examples. Now it‚Äôs time to unpack several core CMS capabilities: from choosing templates to adding SEO plugins... and learn how to use these features in practice.
Imagine you want to create a home-baked-pastries website. How can a CMS help you?
The easiest way to create your site is to use one of the standard website templates. Those templates are pre-designed layouts of web pages that are commonly needed on a website. The CMS will apply the design of each page to your content. 
The video is displayed on the screen showing a website with templates https://hiutdenim.co.uk/ and the voice-over says: 

If you are going to publish DIY home pastry recipes without selling anything, you‚Äôll need to pick a layout from the blog templates. But if you want to sell your own home-baked pastries online, you‚Äôll need an online store template. 
Once you find a template you like, you can simply swap the default text and pictures with your own ‚Äî and thos standard pages will be good to go! 
But that‚Äôs just the start - Later you‚Äôll be able to add new pages - perhaps publish new recipes on your blog or add new products to sell‚Ä¶ and even change the design - all without needing a developer.
You can even take on the role of the SEO specialist and do some basic search engine optimization. For example, you can configure your CMS to generate clean URLs for your web pages.
The URL examples are displayed on the screen:
example.com/product_storeId_10001_catalogId_14552
example.com/flaky-puff-pastry

Just look at those two links. Isn‚Äôt the second one much more people-friendly? It‚Äôs called a clean URL or a semantic URL. Most CMSs will generate ‚Äúclean‚Äù URLs for your website automatically.
But URLs are not the first thing people will look at. When a user searches for something on Google, they get a list of pages relevant to their query. Every page in the search results has a Title highlighted in blue followed by a short description. Using your CMS you can add those titles and descriptions to your pages to make them look great in the search results.



And that‚Äôs not all. Every CMS has a lot of capabilities. You can create and update pages when needed, integrate payment systems, track your website performance and see how many visitors your website has, and much more. To cut a VERY long story short, using a CMS, you can build a website from scratch and manage it yourself."
Explanation of High and Low Quality Content in the Context of Search Engine Optimisation	"Lesson 18. High-quality and low-quality content


Hi. 
In this lesson I‚Äôll be continuing with the topic of content and I‚Äôll explain what makes good quality content and why it‚Äôs important for search engine optimization.
Off we go!

Why is it important to create quality content?

As I mentioned in the previous lesson, content is all the elements you can see on the website. Content attracts traffic, shapes users‚Äô perception of the product, and converts visitors into customers.

What is quality content? First of all, quality must be assessed from the user's point of view. Does the site have what users need? How is this information presented? What does the site look like in general?

Usually, a few seconds are enough to distinguish a low quality, spammy site from a quality one. If the resource is full of advertisements, and the texts are uninformative, it‚Äôs unlikely to be trusted by users, right? 

From the user's point of view, high-quality content is:
‚Ä¢ relevant, useful and informative 
‚Ä¢ encourages users to buy a product or use a service after reading the content
 
Another important function of content is to help promote the website online through all the acquisition channels. 

For example, Search engine optimization is based on the use of keywords that match user queries in the texts and other SEO methods.

Also, search engines evaluate the quality of content through user behavior. If content is read, commented on, linked to, or shared with others, this indicates that visitors find it useful. This is a positive signal for search engines, which tend to rank high those pages that best serve search engine users.

What makes high-quality content?
In order for content to work for your brand image and traffic acquisition, it must meet certain criteria. Let's take a look at the main quality indicators.
Displaying the list on the screen
‚Ä¢ Informative value
‚Ä¢ Uniqueness
‚Ä¢ Proper structure and design
‚Ä¢ Easy to understand
‚Ä¢ Balanced and natural keyword distribution
‚Ä¢ Suitable size
‚Ä¢ Relevant information

All the points are clarified by the voice-over:
‚Ä¢ Informative value.
This is the number one rule. Good content is useful for readers. They find what they were looking for: new information, answers to their questions, ways to solve problems. This is true for all site texts ‚Äî from articles and landing pages to product cards in an online store.
In the best-case scenario, the text should contain comprehensive information presented in a concise manner ‚Äî without noise and unnecessary phrases that don‚Äôt add any value.
‚Ä¢ Uniqueness.
If the text is unique, this is an additional plus to the karma of its value. Judge for yourself, why would a search engine show a copy of the text if it can show the original? Uniqueness is a basic indicator of content quality.
‚Ä¢ Proper structure and design.
To make information easier to consume and digest, the text must have a clear structure. Many users skim read, trying to quickly find exactly what interests them in the text. If the article is divided into blocks with <H> headings, paragraphs, lists, and so on, it is much easier for users to skim the content and find the information they are looking for. Visual elements that complement the text also matter: pictures with examples, infographics, and illustrations all add value and help the user to better consume the text.
‚Ä¢ Easy to grasp.
In addition to the structure, the way your thoughts are expressed is incredibly important. To make it easier for the reader to understand texts, you should write using simple language, avoiding the use of unfamiliar terms and complex speech structures. The perfect scenario is when one sentence contains one thought, and each sentence is a logical follow -on from the last, which creates flow.
‚Ä¢ Balanced and natural keyword distribution.
You can and should use keywords in your content. They provide better visibility in search engines ‚Äî more impressions and clicks. But it is important that you don‚Äôt overdo it - the keyword quantity should be controlled and usage should be relevant and appropriate.
It‚Äôs worth noting that search engines today are able to analyze texts and understand them much like a human would. They understand the topic of web pages, which sections deal with which sub-topic and what sentences actually mean‚Ä¶ and they find matches to a user query based on that understanding. There is no need or point to using exact match keywords for search engines to understand what your page is about.

‚Ä¢ Suitable size.
For SEO, pages shouldn't have very little content. Texts should provide the right amount of helpful information for the user. Longer texts tend to get more impressions and can rank higher because they have a lot of information and keywords ‚Äî with the bonus for you that users spend more time studying them, which means more time on the site.
That said, there are no unified standards regarding the length of a piece of content - you should write the amount that is appropriate to the user's need. For a simple question that requires a simple answer you should provide a simple answer. If the user is looking for a detailed explanation, provide that.
In all cases, you need to ensure that your content matches the user‚Äôs intent, adds value and touches upon the points related to the topic that are relevant to the query.
‚Ä¢ Relevant information.
You may have noticed that for some queries you can see relatively new articles in the SERP. For example, if you google ‚Äúwhere to spend a vacation‚Äù, in the top 10 results, you‚Äôll mostly see 2021 article titles among the search results.

The thing is there is loads of content on the topic and new articles keep appearing. Even a very popular and high-quality article, which is 5 years old, is likely to be pushed out of the top 10 by more recent material because the information is time-sensitive.
So, for your content to be effective, you need to update it regularly.

What makes low-quality content?
But what about low-quality content? Now I‚Äôll highlight the main signs of poor content quality
Displaying the list on the screen
Content noise
Keyword stuffing
 
Inconsistency with the rest of the site content

All points are clarified by the voice-over:
‚Ä¢ Content noise
When content is created not for the user, but simply to fill the page with some information, there is usually a lot of "noise" - unnecessary details, repetitions, deviations from the topic. There is a feeling that the text is ‚Äúabout nothing in particular‚Äù ‚Äî there is essentially little or no value in it at all.

Keyword stuffing
Probably, you have seen texts on websites that are stuffed with so many keywords that they become difficult to read. In the early days of the Internet, when search algorithms were not that advanced, there were plenty of texts overloaded with keywords. Like this one:
Displaying the text on the screen
We sell robotic vacuum cleaners 
Our robotic vacuum cleaners catalog is the best
Get robotic vacuum cleaners at the best price
In the past, stuffing your content with keywords would help you rank higher, but as you already know, things don‚Äôt work this way anymore. Today, keyword stuffing will negatively impact your search rankings. Google does its best to give users the best answers, and keyword-stuffed texts are obviously not the best in any way. 
‚Ä¢ An obvious desire to sell.
Good marketing copywriting is supposed to sell your products or services. But for sales techniques and calls to action to work, they must be carefully integrated into the content. Straightforward and persistent techniques can backfire.
Ideally, you would focus on describing the value of the product to users, the problems it solves for them and how it can make their lives better. This way, they can evaluate the benefits themselves and make an informed decision.
‚Ä¢ Inconsistency with the rest of the site's content.
Texts on a given page may not match the overall topic of a website. Stick to topics that are truly relevant to your audience. An extreme case would be so-called junk sites filled with spam, where most of the content is posted for advertising purposes. In this case, the site exists for the advertising rather than the content - it has a lot of banners and advertising links, and the quality of the content leaves much to be desired. The best case is when the text is relevant for the whole website, or at least for the content category it belongs to. Also, visual elements on the page should not interfere with the content and users should be able to read the text without closing pop-up windows or scrolling through endless banners.

If you stick to quality content best practices, your copy should be an effective tool for promoting your products and increasing relevant traffic to your website.
Now, let‚Äôs move on to other types of content. In addition to text, most pages contain visual elements ‚Äî and by that I mean images.
For your images to have a positive impact on user experience and search rankings, they must also meet certain quality criteria.
What makes a quality image
‚Ä¢ High image resolution
‚Ä¢ Low file size that won‚Äôt overload the site
‚Ä¢ Adaptable image size that adjusts to different screens
‚Ä¢ Image originality and uniqueness
‚Ä¢ Image relevance within the context of the page

All points are clarified by the voice-over:
‚Ä¢ First of all, the pictures must be high resolution.
‚Ä¢ At the same time, the file size needs to be kept low so as not to overload the site, making it slower. The trick between high resolution and file size is to find the right balance that suits the needs of your audience.
‚Ä¢ Images should display correctly on any screen and adjust to different screen sizes.
‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs also better if they are unique - stock images and photos can be used if appropriate, but original visual content will tend to bring you more value in terms of brand image and visibility in search engines.
‚Ä¢ Among other things, all visual elements must be relevant and naturally fit the context of a particular page.

Once you have an idea of what makes top-quality and what kinds of content are to be avoided, you can start building your content strategy. Which, luckily enough, is the topic of the next lesson.
Thanks for watching, see you soon!"
Explanation of Performance Reporting in the Context of Search Engine Optimisation	"Optimizing a website takes a lot of time, effort, and patience, and when it comes to presenting the achieved results, it‚Äôs vital to make your report simple, yet comprehensive and detailed. A tough combination to get right, but I know we‚Äôll manage.

Right. Off we go!

What is an SEO report?
A report is an indispensable tool for any SEO specialist when it comes to communicating success to customers or managers. In fact, an insightful SEO report can be beneficial to practically everyone involved in a project, from marketers and webmasters to product managers and business owners‚Ä¶. and you! 

It gives you a chance to look back, analyze the data and see the big picture. Based on the insights provided by the report, it's relatively simple to understand the reasons for the project‚Äôs ups and downs, see how best to adjust strategy and find new untapped opportunities.

A great SEO report can help you with all these things. So, let‚Äôs look at how you can create a great SEO report. 
How to quickly generate an SEO report?
The most time-efficient way of creating a report is to make use of specialized SEO tools. If you use SEO software to handle all your projects, ideally it will be able to generate a detailed report for you in just a few clicks.
Dedicated, specialised tools can save you hours of routine work. Here I‚Äôm going to walk you through SE Ranking‚Äôs Report Builder as an example. 
There will be a screen record of the SE Ranking‚Äôs Report Builder, and we‚Äôll be demonstrating every point mentioned by the speaker:
All you need to start building a report with SE Ranking is to launch the Report Builder, hit the Generate a Report button, and choose the project you‚Äôre interested in.
Next, you need to set the date range and decide which data to include in your report ‚Äî I‚Äôll tell you which sections I recommend adding to the report in just a minute. Now, the SE Ranking Report Builder offers eight templates for you to choose from, and you can also build a custom report that contains only the sections you choose. You‚Äôll be able to include all the key data to the report, from website rankings to Google Analytics data and competitors‚Äô visibility. 
You can swap the blocks, delete sections that you don‚Äôt need from the templates, and add extra charts and graphs. And you can choose a custom design for the cover page.
The screen record ends, the speaker is shown on the screen:
Once the report is ready, you can save it to the platform, download it as a PDF document or send it by email ‚Äî to yourself, your client or maybe your manager. In the video description, you‚Äôll find a sample report generated using SE Ranking‚Äôs Report Builder.
To spend even less time on reporting in the future, you can save your templates and set up scheduled reports that will be generated and sent automatically to a list of email addresses you provide. 
And, of course, SE Ranking makes it easy to track your progress ‚Äî all your reporting history is easily available in the tool, so you can analyze how your results have changed over time. This is yet another reason to regularly create comprehensive reports. It gives you a chance to look back and see how your past actions impacted the project‚Äôs SEO. 
Which data an SEO report should have?

Now that we‚Äôve figured out how SE Ranking can help you quickly generate a report, let‚Äôs discuss in detail which data you need to add to an SEO report.

I recommend you start with a dashboard with the website‚Äôs key metrics. The exact metrics may vary depending on your goals, but as a rule, a ‚Äúkey metrics‚Äù dashboard should include information on traffic and conversion. This immediately gives an overview of how many people visited the site thanks to your SEO efforts and how many of these visits ended with a goal completion or target action. a ‚Äúkey metrics‚Äù dashboard will also normally include information about search engine rankings, technical health, and backlinks. 


Then each block of metrics should be presented in more detail on dedicated pages. 

Let‚Äôs discuss which data you need to include in your SEO report and why.  

I advise you to add data on website traffic as the first thing after the dashboard. You need to show how many visitors landed on your site from organic search and how your current metrics compare to historical data. 


Screen record shows a user adding the Traffic block to the report in SE Ranking‚Äôs Report Builder. In the block settings, the user chooses the Organic traffic section and shows that there are two options for comparison periods ‚Äî previous period and previous year. Then, the user chooses the Previous period option and hits the Save button. 
Voiceover

The SE Ranking Report Builder allows you to add data on a website‚Äôs organic traffic in just a few clicks. You can compare current data to the previous month or the previous year to evaluate your long-term progress.
In addition to general traffic data, you absolutely need to show analytics for separate website pages. 


Put the image on the screen

For example, you can add the five best-performing and five worst-performing pages to the report and add a note that you‚Äôre planning to work on the latter in the next months. On top of that, you can single out pages that have shown the best results over the past month. Or perhaps the pages that offer the best opportunities for the next SEO ‚Äúpush‚Äù.

The next block will include information on website rankings ‚Äî my advice is to select five to twenty target keywords for every website page you‚Äôre working on. This section of the report will show which rankings bring what amounts of traffic to the website. 


Put the image on the screen

Voiceover
Just like traffic, ranking data should be presented as a comparison. You can compare your current rankings to the rankings you had when the rankings were first checked ‚Äî which means compare now to the date when you started working on a project. Also, you can add a table with a brief ranking history to your report.

You can also compare your rankings to the rankings of your direct competitors ‚Äî that will show how your results measure against other players in the niche. 
Put the image on the screen



The next thing you can show is what has been done to strengthen your website‚Äôs backlink profile. You can add data on how many backlinks you‚Äôve managed to gain in a month, or since the start of the project, and perhaps indicate which pages are gaining the most links, and which anchor texts were used. 


Put the image on the screen

Voiceover
Use graphs to show the data in an easy-to-read format. Once again, because the results of your link building efforts can be slow, it‚Äôs better not to limit yourself to the data for the past month, but to analyze a longer period ‚Äî for example, from the start of the project or the three past months ‚Äî which will show a meaningful trend. It‚Äôs also important to check whether your older backlinks are still there and include this data in the report. 
Put the image on the screen


Voiceover
In addition to graphs, I recommend you add detailed information on every important backlink to the report. This helps stakeholders to understand the dynamics. SE Ranking‚Äôs Backlink Monitoring tool allows you to track a link‚Äôs status ‚Äî whether it is still active or if it was removed from the page ‚Äî along with other key parameters such as indexation status of the linking page, the domain authority of the website, and the anchor text of every link. These metrics allow you to evaluate the quality of each backlink and should demonstrate that your website has a healthy backlink profile that boosts your SEO. 

If you‚Äôve spent some time optimizing technical issues on a website, this should definitely be a part of your SEO report. 


Put the image on the screen


Voiceover
As you saw in the technical SEO module, indexation issues, broken links, improper redirects, a low Core Web Vitals score, and other technical problems can hold a site back in Google‚Äôs ranking. With the help of SE Ranking‚Äôs Website Audit, you can identify any issues and then add charts and tables to the report to point to weaknesses but also to highlight the work that you‚Äôve done.   
At the end of the report, you can add a section that will show how users interact with the pages on your website. If you spend a lot of time and effort on creating quality content, you need to make sure users like it. 
Put the image on the screen

Voiceover
Pay attention to how much time users spend on a page, whether they follow the links on your site or click any buttons. If your behavioral metrics are disappointing, add comments to the section and share your plans on improving the stats ‚Äî for example, if you want to improve content quality or the UX. 



6) One behavioral metric that really deserves a dedicated section is conversions. SEO traffic that you generate should bring profit to the business, which is only possible when users perform target actions on your site. Target actions may vary. Buying a product or a service, starting a free trial, clicking a partner link, or signing up for a promotion can all be target actions. They can all be tracked with the help of Google Analytics ‚Äî you just need to set up goals for every type of action that‚Äôs important to you. 

Put the image on the screen

Voiceover
Your report may feature data on the number of completed goals ‚Äî this could be the number of users who made a purchase or followed a partner link. Also, you can include data on the goal conversion rate such as the percentage of website visitors who performed the target action. 


In addition to the sections on the results you‚Äôve achieved, you can also add a block with your plans on further website optimization. Set out for yourself, your client or your boss what you intend to do in the next month or couple of months, and what results you hope to get. An important note here is that your plans should be based on the data in the current report. For example, if some of the pages have experienced a traffic drop, indicate how you intend to analyze the situation and perhaps also the changes you will be implementing.  

The best part about the Plans section is that it can be used as a reference for your future SEO reports - show that you do what you say you‚Äôll do, and what you do WORKS.

And then, right at the end, the summary ‚Äî a comprehensive report should definitely have a short summary! Graphs, charts, and tables can sometimes be understood at a glance and require no further explanation... but sometimes you need to provide more details. It‚Äôs better to add specific, focussed comments to every section and then summarize in the final section of the report. Here you can single out the most important data, briefly describe the major problems, highlight the best opportunities and comment on the key business metrics. 

Of course, the scenario in this video is not the only possible option, it‚Äôs just a suggestion. I would imagine in most cases, you‚Äôll have most of the sections I covered in this lesson on your report, but you can remove some, add others, swap the order, and shift the focus to the data that is the most important for you by adding extra details or leaving out data points that aren‚Äôt relevant. 

I suggest that you simply use this lesson as a reference to develop your own SEO report template that fits the needs of your specific project. 
And, as I mentioned right at the start, make sure you include the information that will help you to understand the effect of the SEO techniques you are implementing."
Explanation of Keyword Grouping in the Context of Search Engine Optimisation	"Lesson 15. The mechanics of keyword grouping

Hi, and welcome. 
In the last lesson, I explained how you can clean up a keyword list of unnecessary queries. The next steps are v ing and segmentation. They help you properly distribute keywords across the website‚Äôs pages, create optimized  content, implement various SEO techniques, set up PPC ads and more. 
Both clustering and segmentation imply dividing keywords into groups based on some commonalities. Clustering brings keywords together in logical groups that live together, you can then use a group of semantically related keywords on the same page. Meanwhile, segmentation is essential at the final stages of distributing your selected keywords across the site ‚Äî it helps you define which groups of keywords should be used on category pages, which could serve as new blog topics and which perfectly fit the landing pages that target particular regions. If this all sounds too vague, don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî it will get crystal clear once we get to the brass tacks. So, without further ado, off we go!
Basic clustering principles
So, what are the basic principles of clustering?
The first one is clustering by search intent.
Display the phrase 
Clustering by search intent
Targeting keywords with the right intents helps customize a site to the right audience and attract targeted traffic. So, how do you cluster queries based on their intent? In one of the previous lessons, I covered intent classification in detail. So, be sure to watch the video if you missed it or forgot some of the information ‚Äî you‚Äôll find the link in the description right below this video.
For now, let's review the main types of search intent.
Informational 
Commercial 
Transactional
Navigational
Branded

Informational (for example, what is a smart watch); 
Commercial (for example, best smart watch); 
Transactional (for example, buy smart watch); 
Navigational (for example, smart watch London shops)
Branded (for example, Apple smartwatch). 
Your task is to combine search queries with common intent into separate groups. To do this, you should pay attention to intent-specific words. For informational keywords, such words are how, where, why, why, when, and so on. Branded requests always include the company name. Transactional requests contain words such as buy, price, order.
Each group of search queries can ultimately be used for different purposes and pages. For example, informational requests can be targeted in blog posts, commercial, transactional and some branded queries will serve as a basis for your landing pages. Finally, navigational and exact match brand search queries will tend to be targeted by your homepage.
Now, let's proceed to another clustering principle that is based on the search results.
Display the phrase 
Clustering on the basis of search results

Another common type of clustering is based on the search results. With this type of clustering, keywords belong to the same group if you find several pages in the SERP that are common for all the keywords.  To make it clear, let's proceed straight to examples.
Display the screenshot, voice-over:

Let‚Äôs say you have 2 similar search queries: "easy hiit routine" and "hiit workout." Should you promote them on the same page or on different pages? Let's find out with the help of the SERP. All you need is type in these 2 keywords and see if you can find the same sites in both SERPs. In this case, the answer is yes, which means that these keywords can be combined into one cluster. 
If there is no crossover like this, the keywords should be used on different pages and grouped in different clusters. To speed things up, you can use keyword clustering tools ‚Äî SE Ranking has one, and it‚Äôs called Keyword Grouper. In this case, all you need is add your list of keywords, and the tool will do all the heavy lifting for you.
Display a screen record of the Keyword Grouper in action.
Basic principles of keywords segmentation
That‚Äôs it for the basic principles of keyword clustering. Now, let's look at the next stage of working with a keyword list ‚Äî keyword segmentation. 
So, first of all, keywords are segmented by their search volume.
Display the phrase 
Segmentation by search volume

I‚Äôll start by pointing out that search volume is a relative indicator. Each niche can have its own search volume range. For example, the field of home appliances is quite popular: every month, 74 thousand people in the US google ‚Äúmini fridges with freezer‚Äù. In this niche, a search volume of 200 is considered to be low. On the other hand, if you look at the luxury real estate niche and check the search volume of the keyword ‚Äúluxury villa in italy‚Äù, you‚Äôll see that it‚Äôs googled 260 times a month. And this number is considered high in this niche.
The number of monthly search queries is also affected by the size of the geographic area, seasonality, popularity of goods, services, and other factors. Search engines also have different market shares, depending on the country, or a slightly different demographic‚Ä¶ so the search volume of a given search query may differ across various search engines.
Let's review search query types based on their search volume:
Display the text:
High search volume queries
Medium search volume queries
Low search volume queries
Queries with extremely low search volume

High search volume queries are the most popular in the niche. As a rule, the competition for them is higher, and they are not suitable SEO targets for promoting new websites. 
Medium search volume queries are phrases that usually contain clarifications that help define their search intent. This type of search query will provide quality targeted traffic and ranking for them is less difficult, so targeting them in your SEO strategy is fine. If your site is new, don‚Äôt expect quick results for this type of keyword.
Low search volume queries are often overlooked by SEOs. But don‚Äôt jump the gun: they are usually easier to rank for, and among them, you‚Äôll find a lot of long-tail keywords with specific intent, which, if properly optimized, can help you get quick results and get clicks leading to conversions. Remember too that, although the number of clicks per month might be low, if you maintain your ranking over time, that adds up pretty quickly. 15 clicks a month means almost 200 visits a year, and that could mean a dozen sales.
Lastly, search queries with extremely low search volume are phrases that people rarely use when searching. Much of the time, they are dismissed as unpromising since they deliver few impressions and clicks, but in some circumstances these very low volume keywords can be useful for SEO.
The question arises: what are the benefits of grouping queries by their search volume? 
Well, first of all, it helps to assess the potential traffic a website can get. Keyword search volume helps you estimate how many visitors will come to your website if you make it to the top for this query. 
Secondly, segmentation by volume helps create an SEO strategy. For example, you can start by targeting low search volume keywords that are often easier to rank for, get some results under your belt, and gradually start targeting more popular search queries as well.
And thirdly, this method helps you build the site‚Äôs structure. For example, you could use high search volume keywords for the home page, medium search volume keywords for category pages, and low search volume keywords for product pages. Of course, this example is a generalisation, so don‚Äôt take it literally. In reality, web pages contain keywords with different search volumes.
Let's move on to the next principle ‚Äî segmenting keywords by the target region.
Display the phrase 
Segmentation by target regions

All queries can be divided into local and non-local.
Display the requests
pancake recipes
Cinderella cartoon online
why birds fly

Take a look at these keywords ‚Äî 'pancake recipes,' 'cinderella cartoon online,' 'why birds fly.' They are non-local.
There's no mention of city or country in non-local queries. The region of the search does not matter to the user. 
Local queries indicate the user's desire to get a service or purchase a product based on their location.
Display queries and highlight "in Ukraine" and " Kyiv" 
buy a sofa with delivery across the UK
beauty salon Liverpool

For example, "buy a sofa with delivery across the UK," "beauty salon Liverpool." 
A retail chain with outlets in several cities or a company providing nationwide delivery should have separate query groups for each target region for SEO.
Today, search engines can obtain information about a user‚Äôs location from the settings of their device. Therefore, sometimes the local intent is implicit and not immediately obvious from the query itself. In these cases, the query doesn‚Äôt include the town, city or country but is local nonetheless. For example, if you google "pizza delivery" or "order a taxi," the intent is implicitly local and you‚Äôll get at least some local businesses in the search results.
Display a video ‚Äî screen recording where you enter a "pizza delivery" query in Google, and the results with delivery options in New York appear
Bear in mind that the search volume of search queries with no mention of the location will be higher‚Ä¶ and so will the competition! 
The method of grouping keywords by target regions is suitable for businesses operating in different towns, regions or even countries. Geographic groupings can be used to create dedicated landing pages for different cities, for example."
Explanation of Different WebPage Elements in the Context of Search Engine Optimisation	"Search filters and product sorting
If you have a lot of articles on your blog, or products in your online shop, your website visitors may want to use search filters and sorting to quickly find what they want. 
 





Most often you‚Äôll see filters in the left sidebar or fixed to the top of the page.

 





Many online shops give users an option to sort products by price, rating, alphabet, and other attributes.

Your site filters and sorting options should be easy for your site visitor to set and adjust. For good usability, they should be powered by solid algorithms that sort items correctly, allow multiple filter values in one category, and be ranked by importance to the user.

From the standpoint of technical SEO, filters and sorting features can cause issues with duplicate content ‚Äî they can create thousands of pages that are very, very similar to each other. So, make sure filtered and sorted results that are too similar aren't being indexed as separate pages. To prevent any duplicate content issues, you need to set up canonical URLs  properly or block Google from crawling and indexing these URLs. I explained how to manage robots.txt and the robots meta tag in a previous lesson.
Frequently Asked Questions
Most companies have FAQ sections or pages on their websites. FAQ pages usually address common questions that customers ask about products, services, the website and the brand itself. 



 

FAQ pages are generally intended to decrease the workload of the support team and shorten customer buying journeys. They serve as the first contact point for customers before they reach out to a support representative.

But that‚Äôs not the only purpose your FAQ page can serve. FAQ pages have great SEO potential. To benefit from it, you can answer questions about and around your brand and products that are highly relevant. Ideally, you‚Äôll include the FAQ structured data markup to your page since this helps Google enormously.
If done right, your FAQ page can not only rank in the blue links in the SERPs, but also trigger Featured Snippets and appear in the People Also Ask section - that represents multiple opportunities for search visibility that has the potential to drive a lot of incredibly relevant traffic. 
Social proof and brand loyalty
Some website design elements will help you build trust. For example, you can show the number of customers you currently have and feature famous clients or testimonials. 

  





You can also show badges, trust seals, and ratings you earn from review platforms and authoritative research and advisory companies.   

Among all the social proof elements, testimonials and customer reviews look REALLY convincing to your potential clients. The simplest way to add them to your site is a carousel with your customers‚Äô quotes describing how your company helped them. You can make your testimonials look more compelling and convincing by adding your clients‚Äô photos and links to their social profiles. 






You can even go a step further and record short video testimonials or customer success stories. If you want to make your customer page truly impressive, blend short video testimonials with quote snippets and support them with links to related case studies.
Social share buttons
Your readers or customers may want to share your pages on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, or other social platforms. By having social share buttons on your website, you make sharing super-easy for your visitors, and they‚Äôll thank you for that with lots of shares :)







For example, you can add the Tweetable Quote feature to your blog. Now if someone wants to tweet a quote, statistics, or a catchy phrase from your article, they can do so in one click. 

With social share buttons, your website visitors can, and probably will, share your content which gets you in front of their audience - potentially people who didn‚Äôt know about you or your products before‚Ä¶ and the best thing is that social posts are seen as recommendations, which makes them extra-effective in marketing.
Interactive elements
Interactive elements help you transform an ordinary static web page into an entertaining or useful tool. Interactive pages capture people‚Äôs attention and make them stay and spend more time on your website. There‚Äôs now a lot of tools that could help you engage your visitors: online quizzes, interactive calculators, and virtual product testing. 





For example, many online magazines now embed quizzes to inform and entertain their readers. B2B companies use quizzes to engage with potential customers and unobtrusively learn more about their preferences, pain points and needs.






Meanwhile, large online cosmetics stores often offer virtual makeup and hairstyle try-on tools. People can apply different makeup looks and hairstyles to a photo of theirs or even use a live camera mode, which is REALLY engaging!
Webpage elements layout
To build a great website you should decide what types of pages you‚Äôll need and what structural elements they should consist of. First, consider best practices in your industry so you are sure to include all the must-haves, then think about how you can innovate and differentiate.
For example, if you want to create a landing page for an online marketing course. Then adding a detailed course syllabus would be a must-do. Then, providing video testimonials from former students as social proof would be your way to stand out.
As soon as you know what sections you want to add to your page, create a wireframe of the page in a text editor. This will help you estimate how much text you‚Äôll have for every section. At this stage, you can easily tweak, add, and remove pieces to make page content more balanced.
In the next stage, you‚Äôll draw a mockup of the page to fit your text blocks into a design layout. The mockup should demonstrate what the future page will look like and define the core visual aspects of the design. A mockup will enable you to select a suitable pre-designed template and customize it, or order a custom design from a professional web designer.
Let‚Äôs sum it up. You can create a website by:
* Combining web design elements into a wireframe layout
* Organizing these elements based on page goals
* Tweaking a template or hiring a web designer
* Combining proven web design elements into a wireframe layout by following the best practices that we discussed today
* Then you can choose web design elements and organize them depending on the goals of each page
* And to finalize the look and feel of your website design, you‚Äôll need to choose and tweak a pre-designed template or hire a professional web designer."
Explanation of Different Types of Web Content in the Context of Search Engine Optimisation	"What is content?

Everything you see on the Internet is content: texts, photos, ads, posts on social networks, videos on YouTube, and so on.

"Content is King" was the title of a 1996 essay by Bill Gates. In it, he predicted the Internet to be the future major distributor of information, and his expression is still relevant today. Content is a powerful tool of influence on the Internet and user expectations about format and quality are constantly changing.

If we talk about websites, content is everything that is inside the site and visible to the user, such as:
‚Ä¢ Texts
‚Ä¢ Images
‚Ä¢ Multimedia files (video, audio)
‚Ä¢ Interface elements (menus, buttons, the upper block of the page, header, lower block, footer)
‚Ä¢ Interactive elements

The content of the site forms the image of the company, helps a website gain a higher search ranking, and attracts customers. So it is THE core!

With that said, let's take a closer look at what content is and how to use it correctly.

Types of content and their use

The main content type is text.

The texts on a site can perform the following tasks:




Texts on the website can:

1. Answer user questions
2. Describe the benefits of products and the company
3. Encourage users to perform a targeted action
4. Contain keywords

Voiceover:

‚Ä¢ First, they can answer user questions.
‚Ä¢ Second, they can describe the benefits of the product and the company.
‚Ä¢ Third, texts can encourage users to perform a targeted action on the site (place an order, fill in a form, etc.).
‚Ä¢ Fourth, the texts may contain keywords that are important for ranking in user search queries.

Sites use different types of texts


Brand content ‚Äî general information about the company, brand, and the team
Product content ‚Äî descriptions of goods and services, optimized for search queries
Promotional  texts ‚Äî landing pages created to support promotions and special offers
Educational texts ‚Äî expert blog articles, instructions and guides
Viral texts ‚Äî aimed at encouraging people to share the content on social networks
Use cases ‚Äî  examples of the company's clients using products to boost their growth
Event announcements and company news

Voiceover:

‚Ä¢ Brand content - general information about the company, brand, and the team;
‚Ä¢ Product content - descriptions of goods and services, optimized for search queries;
‚Ä¢ Promotional texts - created to support various promotions and special offers, often in the format of landing pages;
‚Ä¢ Educational texts - expert blog articles, instructions, guides which can be free or offered in exchange for an email subscription;
‚Ä¢ Viral texts - created in order to get as many people as possible to share the content on their social networks;
‚Ä¢ Use cases - real-world examples of the company's clients using its products to boost their own growth;
‚Ä¢ Event announcements and company news.

Images are another important type of content.
Usually, they are used on the site as:
‚Ä¢ Pictures and charts
‚Ä¢ Infographics
‚Ä¢ Product images
‚Ä¢ Advertising banners
‚Ä¢ Navigational elements
‚Ä¢ Page background

‚Ä¢ Illustrations embedded into the flow of copywriting in the form of pictures or charts
‚Ä¢ Infographics
‚Ä¢ Product images
‚Ä¢ Advertising banners
‚Ä¢ Navigational elements ‚Äî when a picture is used as a button
‚Ä¢ As a background on the page
Generally speaking, pictures support copywriting and make the underlying message more memorable. Amongst other things, they can be used to help people choose a product or encourage them to find out more about a company's offers. Additionally, optimizing images will increase the chances of your site getting into the "Images" section of search results, which provides additional brand awareness and some will attract additional traffic to the site.
Various Multimedia files are also examples of content

Video is an incredibly popular promotional tool today because video allows you to convey the advantage of goods and services quickly and clearly. In addition, the popularity of YouTube and  user engagement make videos even more effective.

Podcasts are also quite popular today - many people love podcasts because they offer a means to consume the content as a background activity - whilst cycling, walking, exercising and so on. 

Let‚Äôs look at Interface elements
The website interface is responsible for the way a website looks and feels to a user, and is also the foundation of usability. Good UX combined with useful content has a positive effect on behavioral factors: the time users spend on the site, the number of pages viewed, the number of conversions and so on.
Finally, the site may have Interactive elements
Interactive elements are part of web design. They can significantly improve the design of a page and the way users perceive and interact with it. Here, we‚Äôre talking about all kinds of clickable elements, animation effects, and so on. They can engage visitors, keep them on the site, increasing the chances of conversion and that will have a positive impact on rankings. On the other hand, interactive elements can slow down website loading, which is bad for both users and SEO. I'll talk more about the role of loading speed in website optimization in the technical SEO module.
In this lesson, we looked at all the main types of content. In the next lesson, I'll talk about how to distinguish quality content and explain how it benefits your website."
Explanation of Creating a Website in the Context of Search Engine Optimisation	"What do you need to create a website?

The first thing you need to do is to imagine how your future website will work. To do this, you can look at competitors' sites ‚Äî explore them, click on buttons, go to different sections, and see what's out there. 

Then, try to answer the questions:

Display the questions, and the voice reads them out:

What do I want to tell the website visitor?
What action do they need to take on my website?
How will I sell my service or product through the website?
Do I need to accept payments? 
Which competitors' websites do I like and why? 
What aspects of my competitors' websites DON‚ÄôT I like and why? 

If you can't answer all the questions straight away, don't worry ‚Äî it's okay. It‚Äôs well worth thinking through the whole process and writing down the main points. 

The second important point is to decide how you will be attracting visitors to your website. From the get-go, you need to understand how people will find your site, and which search engine they will use. 

For example, if you hope to get visits from Google, part of your site plan will be to structure your site with Google‚Äôs ranking algorithms in mind.

It may seem complicated now, but we'll explore all the points in detail in the next lessons. For now, let's understand how much it costs on average to build a website and how long it will take.

How much does it cost to create a website?
As you probably have already guessed, the cost depends on the scale of the site, its functionality, and the complexity of development. 

Prices vary enormously, but here are some ‚Äúrule of thumb‚Äù price tags so you have an idea when you start negotiating:

 

A website from scratch with a developer‚Äôs help ‚Äî starting at $1,000 
Online shop from scratch with a developer‚Äôs help ‚Äî starting at $5,000 
A 2 or 3 page site with off-the-peg design based on a popular CMS ‚Äî about $500
Online shop with off-the-peg design based on a CMS ‚Äî from $3,000
A DIY site based on an online builder ‚Äî around $100 a year or for free





Developing a simple business website from scratch with the help of a developer will cost you $1,000 and up. If you need an online shop, expect to spend from $5,000 up to infinity, depending on your preferences. 
Creating a simple site based on a popular Content Management System will cost approximately $500. I‚Äôll talk about Content Management Systems in more detail in a few minutes. If you build a CMS-based online shop, the price will start from $3,000 up to infinity, depending on your preferences.  
And the last option is a DIY site created with the help of a website builder, which is the cheapest possible option. You can either create a website for free or pay a modest amount of about $100 per year.

It is worth noting that we have listed the costs of creating a website without taking into account the purchase of the domain and hosting. We will talk about those in the next lesson. 

How much time does it take to create a website?
To answer the question "How much time does it take to create a website?" we need to remember that there are many formats, from simple single-page sites to vast and complex online shops with a shopping cart and integrated payment systems. Depending on the complexity of the site, you can expect to have a one-page site done in 10-15 working days, and to have your online shop up and running in about 30 working days.

Importantly, I haven‚Äôt talked about creating the content - the copywriting, getting the right images and so on. That will take you a lot of time, so don‚Äôt get caught out with that!

What is required to build a website?

After you've come up with a vision of your future site, sketched its structure, header menu items, and the approximate arrangement of the blocks, you need to decide on a Content Management System - otherwise known by the acronym ‚ÄúCMS‚Äù. 

Display the text, then the focus returns to the speaker:
 Step 1.Choose a CMS (Content Management System)



A CMS is a platform that helps you create a website by generating HTML code for your website pages. It's like an empty apartment in a new building, where you bring your furniture, and put up wallpaper‚Ä¶ but before that, you plaster everything and do all the preparatory work. 

Think which CMS to go for ‚Äî paid or free. Decide if you‚Äôll be doing everything on your own or if web developers will be involved. There are plenty of solutions in the market for every possible scenario. You may have heard of some of the most popular CMSs, such as WordPress, Wix, Magento, Joomla, but there are many others.

At this stage, you also need to think about a hosting service‚Äî the place your website will be stored. Theoretically, you could store everything on your home computer, but when it comes to a serious project, this is not a good option. Since your website needs to be available 24/7 and your computer isn‚Äôt on 24/7 that already makes this idea impractical, if not impossible. But also, trying this would be complex, time consuming, and would not be safe. 

So, it is better to rent space on a server from a hosting provider. A server is just a fancy name for a publicly accessible computer that runs 24/7. This way, your website will be accessible to your users 365 days a year, 24 hours a day‚Ä¶ it will be fast and reliable for your users‚Ä¶ and you don‚Äôt have to worry about all that part of your online business. In other words, you get rid of a massive headache, though not for free. Expect to pay anything from 20$ a month upwards, depending on the level of service and complexity of your website.
.

2. The next step is to choose a domain name. 

Display the text, then the focus returns to the speaker:

Step 2. Select a domain name 

This is the address your site can be found and reached through. You type the domain name into a browser's address bar, and ‚Äúvoila!‚Äù...

Without a domain name, your site would open with the help of an IP address that looks like a bunch of numbers, which isn't user friendly. It‚Äôs important to choose a concise domain name that your customers will be able to easily remember. For example, facebook.com is much easier to read, remember and type into a browser than 7777besttaxiinnewyork.com. Also, without a domain name, you won't be able to install an SSL certificate ‚Äî a file that allows users to connect to your website securely. Just like with hosting, you cannot run a website without a domain name. 
Domain names cost between 4 and 20$ a year.

3.  Now, you have a CMS, hosting, and a domain name. Now, you can begin filling your site with content. 

Display the text, then the focus returns to the speaker:

Step 3. Filling the site with content 


You can start by filling it with placeholder images and texts to see how the elements will look with the design. You can even ask people you know to test your site and share their opinion. Ask them if your site is user-friendly, looks good, and if all the buttons work properly.

When adding content to your website, make sure that all the texts are your own and that they are unique. That is super-important for SEO. For images, if you are on a tight budget and schedule, you can use stock images, or if you have time and resources, stand out from the crowd and go for bespoke.

4. Now, you can launch the site. 

Display an inset:

       Step 4. Open your site
for indexing and start doing SEO


Open the site for search engine indexing and start your promotion. At this stage, the site should already be tested and ready to meet and greet its first visitors. 

Before we finish the first lesson of this module, here are a few tips: 

Be sure to consult experts before creating a website. Draw the structure of the site on a piece of paper and briefly describe how your site should work.
In most cases, it is best to choose a popular CMS, which will give you plenty of vital features easily and at the best possible price."
Explanation of The Basics of On Page Optimisation in the Context of Search Engine Optimisation	"At first glance, the ‚Äútrick‚Äù is obvious‚Äîcreate great content‚Äîbut there are some caveats.
It may be that you write a great article about hiking for beginners and everyone who reads it raves about it. You‚Äôd think that it would show up on page one on Google simply because everyone seems to love it. But it doesn‚Äôt :(

Or, let's say, you sell hiking equipment on Instagram and your website. One day you notice that the page for your Instagram top-selling sleeping bag doesn‚Äôt rank page 1 on Google. 

In both cases, you know for sure that there's nothing wrong with the content quality or product popularity - everyone loves it. So, what‚Äôs to blame for a low ranking? 
Most probably, you didn‚Äôt consider how search engines work when you wrote the article or created your product page. You need to package that content for Google. You need to add some on-page elements that seduce and charm search engines.

You might also have missed a trick when you created the pages - perhaps you didn‚Äôt put your future visitors‚Äô experience front and center. Ask yourself whether you‚Äôd read the article or buy the sleeping bag if you were a user who came to those pages from a search engine. If you don‚Äôt get a firm ‚Äúyes‚Äù, the pages need improvement.
What is on-page SEO?

On-page SEO encompasses a range of tasks on optimizing the content and code of individual web pages to make them rank higher in the search results. You can apply on-page SEO to both new and existing pages. Its main goal is to ensure that every page element that search engines care about is in its place. Now let‚Äôs look at what those elements are.
Title and Description

Let‚Äôs draw the parallels between your web page and a store in a shopping mall. To understand what goods the store sells, you look at its sign and storefront. Title and description tags are your web page‚Äôs sign and storefront in the search results. 

The title tag defines the name of your web page that shows up as a blue link on SERP. Similar to a store‚Äôs sign, it explains to people what they should expect to see after they click.

The description tag summarizes the content of your page in one or two sentences. It aims to further clarify exactly what people will find on the page. 


  
Sometimes you just can‚Äôt grasp what the store sells just by reading the sign. But after seeing a pair of shoes in the shop window, you get the idea.

Those title and description tags are parts of your page‚Äôs HTML code. If you use a content management system, for example, WordPress, you can add them and edit them without even knowing how to code. 

Not only should you add title and description tags to all of your pages, but you really should optimise them. Later in this module, I‚Äôll show you examples of good and bad titles and descriptions, and we‚Äôll look at them in detail. For now, let‚Äôs list the basic requirements they should meet.

Those tags should be informative and enticing enough for people to click. You also want to use keywords in those tags to let both people and search bots know what's on the page.

But you should take time to choose relevant keywords and write them well - they are super important to your SEO success. 

An animated text is displayed on the screen to illustrate a bad example (add a red cross and/or the sound of disapproval):

Sleeping Bag Winter Liner Camping Buy USA



If your title is something like "Sleeping Bag Winter Liner Camping Buy USA", it won't look any good, even though people do type queries like that in the search bar.

An animated text is displayed on the screen to illustrate a good example (add a green checkmark and/or the sound of approval):

TREKMATES Micro Fleece Sleeping Bag Liner



Assuming that you sell Treckmates sleeping bags, a suitable title tag would appeal to people as well as search engines and read something like ‚ÄúTREKMATES Micro Fleece Sleeping Bag Liner‚Äù

But then how do you let the search engine know that your sleeping bag liner is for the winter season and that you sell only in the US? The rest of your page content will help you to cover those aspects - you don‚Äôt need to say everything in the title :)

Now let‚Äôs dig deeper and figure out what else you should optimize after you set up your title and description tags.
Page headline 

The first thing a visitor sees when they land on your web page is the headline. For example, it may be the name of the product that‚Äôs sold on that page.

The primary heading of the page is marked with the <h1> tag in the HTML code.





Similar to the title, the heading shows visitors and crawlers what the page is about. So, it should meet the same criteria - it needs to be simple, informative, use compelling language, and include keywords.
Page content

Now let‚Äôs talk about the main content of the page: body text and images. Today's search engines are VERY sensitive to content quality. So, if a page doesn't give value to the user, it simply won't rank well.

But what makes content valuable? I've talked about this in the previous lessons, but let's briefly recap.

When it comes to articles, blogs, or landing pages, the text needs to be unique and informative. But simply rewriting a popular guide on hiking in your own words won't do the trick. You are copying, and the original will tend to rank higher than copies. 

The right approach would be to write a better, more helpful and valuable article. You‚Äôd need to write a more relevant and helpful article on the topic. That might mean more in depth, or it might mean clearer. In either case, ideally you'd include some information that hasn't been covered anywhere on the internet yet. For example, add some fresh comments from a recognised expert.

A good idea is to look through competitor pages that rank on page one of Google for the topic before you start writing. To squeeze competitors out of the top ten, your article should be better than theirs. 
If you're thinking of an update for an existing page on your site, then checking the equivalent content on your competitors‚Äô sites will also help you figure out how to improve your own.

When looking at competitor articles you should analyze the keywords they have included. By understanding what people are looking for, you'll cover the nuances your audience cares about. 

From the previous lessons, you already know how to collect keywords, cluster them, and distribute them between your website‚Äôs pages. By manually checking what Google shows for each keyword on your list, you'll see what people expect to find when using them. Then, just make sure you write about that in your article :)

Be sure to use relevant keywords and vocabulary in your copy. But don't overuse them or your text will feel spammy and unnatural to visitors.

One more thing to remember is that your text should be well-organized and easy to read. An article with subheadings and short paragraphs is easier to read and more compelling than a solid wall of uninterrupted text.

You need to make your content scan-readable. What do I mean by that? Make it easy for people and search engine to easily extract the key points you are making.

A picture is displayed on the screen:



TO do that, use headings, bulleted lists, charts, and images to structure your text and visually divide it into smaller blocks. This will help your readers easily grasp the information, and help search bots immensely. If you need to describe complex processes, write about them, but also visualize them in schemas and diagrams. When you explain how a program works, explain it in text, but also add videos or images.
Product pages
For product pages on online stores, generally, you won‚Äôt have much text. Still, it‚Äôs important to describe every product in detail and emphasize its key characteristics and advantages.
For example, for a sleeping bag, display its temperature rating, size, and weight - these are key factors that influence people‚Äôs choices. Including this information in your product description is a must-have, preferably with your own, original and helpful spin. For example, you might explain advantages your competitors haven‚Äôt mentioned: that a compression sack  simplifies packing or that insulation in the bottom keeps feet warm. 
Images

Images are another essential part of a product page. That's especially true for products that people choose based on appearance. The best practice is to add multiple high-quality images for a product to let people see it from different angles.

In terms of SEO, unique images are generally much more valuable. Therefore, making your own photoset of the products you sell is better than using the images provided by the manufacturer. The same is true for blog content. For an article about hiking, the photos you made during your own trips would work much better than stock photos. Although the latter may be more beautiful, they've been used on thousands of websites across the internet and won't add much SEO value.

For technical optimization, it's important to compress images before adding them to your pages. You can use one of the image editing programs or online services for that and be confident that your images don't harm your page loading speed.

Finally, you should take advantage of alternative text (also known as alt text) for every image you use. These are the textual descriptions of images added to the alt attribute of the image tag in the HTML code of the page. Website visitors will see the alt text if an image doesn't load properly, and screen readers use this text to help people with visual disabilities. And, from an SEO perspective, search engine crawlers will use them to better understand what's in the picture. Adding alt attributes not only helps people, but also raises your chances of ranking higher in image results.

The picture is displayed on the screen:





Adding alt attributes is necessary if you want to get your content featured on the image section of Google's search results.
How to optimize video? 
The last thing I'll touch upon today is video content. The popularity of video just keeps growing and growing. And that growth isn‚Äôt likely to slow down anytime soon. For some types of search queries, Google now shows videos on top of the main search results page so that you don't even need to open the video content tab.

Google tends to feature YouTube videos, but don‚Äôt ignore other platforms‚Äîvideos from other websites also make it to the top. Facebook, Twitter, Vimeo, and even your own site can get a place. You can help Google by providing information about your videos‚Äîsuch as title, duration, ratings, or a preview image‚Äîusing structured data markup."
Explanation of Backlinks and Backlink Quality in the Context of Search Engine Optimisation	"Lesson 38. Distribution of link equity and ways to get quality backlinks

Hi, and welcome to another lesson in the Basic SEO course. 
 In this lesson, my goal is to familiarize you with the concepts of link building. In the previous lesson, you learned the key link building terms and what makes a quality backlink. This time, I am going to focus on the process of getting backlinks.

Passing the link equity 
As mentioned earlier, link equity is the page authority that can be passed on to other pages. You‚Äôll often hear link equity referred to as link juice.

Let's consider a simple example. Imagine that your site is a river, and backlinks are tributaries. The more tributaries there are and the wider each of them is, the more water flows through your river, that is, the greater the authority of your site is. The width of a tributary can be compared with the quality and authority of a referring site.

This width doesn't always stay the same. A link can pass only partial link equity in several cases:
It‚Äôs irrelevant to the topic
Uninformative or spammy anchor text is used
A referring site is located in a non-relevant region
The link has a no-follow attribute notifying search engines that they should not follow it

Share the screen with the chart:

 
 



In this infographic, A is the best case scenario: this external resource completely matches your topic, the link has an informative anchor text, the main region is the same as the targeted one, and no restricting link attributes are used. This link will pass along the maximum link equity of referring site A.

Site B has higher initial authority, but unlike link A, link B doesn‚Äôt fully meet the quality standards highlighted above. Therefore, the link value decreases. 

As you can see, a linking site with a lower initial quality can end up passing more link equity than a higher quality one because the link equity that the link passes is ultimately determined by a combination of the authority of the referring website and the criteria I mentioned earlier.
How to get links?
So, how do you get quality links for your site?

First, you need to find candidate websites. The easiest way to do this is by analyzing the backlink profiles of your competitors. You can do this using an SEO tool that monitors backlink databases and provides data on their parameters.

With SE Ranking, you can analyze the backlinks of any domain:
Share the screenshot:



Enter the competitor site's URL in the Backlink Analysis tool and export a list of its backlinks. This way, you‚Äôll see which domains and pages link to your competitor and you‚Äôll be able to contact these sites and see if you can arrange a backlink for your site. 
Be a little bit wary, though. For this, and all SEO tactics and strategies, copying your competitor needs to be done intelligently. It isn't because your competitors do something that it is necessarily a good idea ! Your competitors might have some irrelevant, unhelpful, equity-less backlinks, or even some damaging spam links. Obviously you want to copy their good work, not their mistakes :)

Let‚Äôs see how this can be done in more detail.
Guest posting
Guest posting is a great link-building strategy. It consists of adding one or more links to an article that you write for a third-party resource.
 
Guest posting requires significant financial and time resources ‚Äî you need to contact website owners and pitch your idea for an article on their blog‚Ä¶ once someone accepts, you then need to write the article that includes a logical link to your site that makes sense for their user. 

You can negotiate a partnership and ‚Äúswap‚Äù articles  ‚Äî that is, you post on their blog, they post on yours. Or you might be asked to pay. Guest posts aren‚Äôt always free of charge ‚Äî which is something Google frowns upon - but in many cases these backlinks will still bring value to your website provided that they meet all the quality criteria I mentioned above.  

The most important part of guest posting is the quality of the article. It should be relevant to the topic of both the host site and the target site, and the link should fit naturally into the text. If your site and the referring site belong to the same or a complimentary niche, it‚Äôs easy to come up with an adequate topic. If the sites are from different niches, let‚Äôs say about cars and cats you can get super creative and write about "Tips for transporting cats in cars over long distances", but bear in mind that it might well not be the best use of your resources since links from non-relevant sites have less value.
Comments 
Another common type of backlink is one that is added in the comments sections and across various forums. Because of abuse, the search engines introduced a specific UGC attribute for these types of links, which prevents them from passing link equity. But as long as you stick on topic, and the link is truly helpful to the user, these links can be helpful.
You need to find forums and pages that discuss issues where providing a link to your website will truly help. For example, if you promote a car service, your goal is to find a post on a forum for car drivers and link from there to a page on your website that directly solves the problem being discussed. 
Profiles
Links from user profiles are easy to generate, but less valuable for most general SEO purposes. They can be helpful since they diversify the backlink profile. The method is simple: find a relevant website that caters for your target audience where you can register your profile ‚Äî forums, company directories, and hobby clubs are all suitable options. Be warned, for this to bring any value at all, the profile page must be visible to all users, even unregistered ones, otherwise, search engines will simply not find the link in your profile.

Once you have created your profile, you should fill it out as much as possible: add  information about yourself, photos, etc. Typically these will link back to your homepage or about page. 

Content and links on profile pages are a very important part of my niche in SEO - Brand SERPs and Knowledge Panels. That isn‚Äôt the subject of this course, but please google my name if you want to find out more.

Link building as a process

Always remember that SEO is more of a marathon than a sprint. Since it's a long game, you don‚Äôt need 20 backlinks a week, but you do need to ensure that you can consistently gain backlinks for your website. Your main goal is to maintain the frequency and quality of the links you get. The ideal scenario is to consistently increase their number over time. 

Also, think about variety: aim for different types of links, use a range of anchor texts, spread over different domains.

That‚Äôs it for this brief introduction to link building. In the next module, we'll discuss SEO metrics and analytics tracking. 

Thank you for watching and see you soon!"
Explanation of How search engines crawl, index, and rank web pages in the Context of Search Engine Optimisation	"In this lesson, I‚Äôll dive into the most fundamental aspect of SEO: how the search engines collect and store the information from billions of websites in the world, including yours.  
In the first lesson of this course, I already touched on the subject of ranking, crawling, and indexing. Let‚Äôs go over this theoretical part in more detail. 
A quick reminder of what we are aiming for with SEO as website owners.
When a user submits a query, a search engine analyzes the query and displays the results containing a list of sites ordered by how well they fit the user‚Äôs request. The process of selecting and prioritizing web pages is called ranking. The page containing the search results is called SERP or Search Engine Results Page.



We can compare the ranking process to a game where different players (or web pages) compete against each other for a particular search query. And the one that best meets the user‚Äôs need according to the search engine‚Äôs criteria, eventually wins. 
But it‚Äôs not as simple as it sounds. To participate in this contest, your website has to go through a selection process. First, web spiders (or bots) scan all of the website‚Äôs known URLs. This is called the crawling stage. Then, the bots collect and store data from the web pages, which is called indexing. And finally, the website and its pages can compete in the game to try to rank for a specific query.
The goal of crawling, indexing, and ranking
To crawl and index pages, a search engine uses web spiders (or crawlers)‚ÄîInternet bots that systematically browse and analyze web pages 24 hours a day. These ‚Äúbots‚Äù are actually just software that visits pages one after the other, just like a human but much, much faster and at a scale you cannot imagine - hundreds of billions of pages every day!
At website level, Crawlers visit a website and browse the pages. They come back again and again over time and rescan the pages to check for content updates. During this process, web spiders evaluate the quality of the pages, taking into account their own criteria that will eventually affect rankings.
At every stage of the process, search engines pay great attention to content quality. That‚Äôs why crawlers can ‚Äúfilter‚Äù, meaning they skip VERY low quality pages and thus ultimately prevent those pages from being displayed in the search results if the content violates the search engine‚Äôs policies.  
Filtering may happen if a website engages in ‚Äúblack hat‚Äù practices, such as automatically generated texts, hidden content, churn and burn SEO, or has a lot of low-quality pages that add little or no value for the  user. 
The main goal of crawling and indexing is to find and evaluate all the site‚Äôs pages, which gives them the opportunity to join the game and try to rank when people enter a search query in  Google. 
Let‚Äôs take a closer look at each of the three steps in this process. 
What is crawling?
Voiceover explanation for the image on the screen
A crawler visits a web page, analyzes it, and follows links on the page, much like users would if they were browsing the content online. Before scanning a web page, a crawler looks into a file called ‚Äúrobots.txt‚Äù that the webmaster has placed in the root directory of the website. Not every page is eligible to be shown in the search results. For example, a website owner may hide internal or outdated pages from crawlers. The file robots.txt contains instructions about   which pages may and may not be crawled.     
During crawling, the software finds new URLs as well as changes to existing pages and dead links. 
What is indexing and how does it work?
After crawling comes indexing (or indexation)‚Äîa process of storing the information from  websites in a database called an index. In the third step, as we‚Äôll see later in this lesson, pages that have been indexed are ranked to be displayed in the SERP for relevant queries. In short, if you want users to find your website on Google, it needs to be indexed.
Web crawlers index pages, and their content, including text, internal links, images, audio and video files. 
If the content is considered to be valuable and competitive, the search engine will add the page to the index and it will be in the ‚Äúgame‚Äù to compete for a place in the search results for relevant user search queries.  
How can you influence the indexing process?
You can help speed up the indexing process by providing the bot with a list of URLs to your content, known as a sitemap. You can submit this to Google through the  Google Search Console service
You can block some pages from indexing using the robots meta tag or the x-robots tag.
You can remove specific pages from Google‚Äôs index using a dedicated tool they provide in Search Console.

How search engine ranking works?
Let‚Äôs move on to the final stage and learn about how search engine ranking works. 
Ranking algorithms are designed to sort through billions of pages in the index to determine the most relevant results, and then prioritize and display them in a way that helps users find what they are looking for. The contents of the search results depend on a whole series of factors.
Search engines analyze a user query and evaluate the topical relevance of pages, their expertise, and how closely their content matches the search intent. Among other important factors are the loading speed, usability, the number and quality of external links, and many other parameters that influence its appreciation of the content quality and the  website‚Äôs authority.
Key ranking factors
Let‚Äôs now take a look at the key factors that help determine the ranking positions of a page. We can roughly divide them into on-page and off-page factors. 
On-page ranking factors
One of the main on-page ranking factors is the content topic.  
For pages to appear in the search results, it should contain information that matches a user query. Search engines determine the topic of a page using complex algorithms. They are looking for particular words and phrases and pay particular attention to  the page headings and the title tag, which represents the name of the page in the search results. Algorithms also take into account external links and their context.
All this is just a small part of the factors that search engines consider when analyzing resources. And of course, no one knows for sure how exactly the algorithms work. Therefore, when creating a new page, you should focus on users rather than search engines, and create content that is highly relevant to the search query.
The next factor is content quality.
Search algorithms always prioritize useful and unique pages. Such practices as keyword stuffing reduce the content quality for users and search engines. It is better to create structured articles and to place h1-h6 headings in a logical order. 
But your major focus in terms of quality should always be creating content that is helpful and valuable to the user in the context of their search query.
Another important factor is internal linking. 
Sites that link their pages to each other in a relevant and helpful manner make it easier for users to navigate, quickly find relevant information as well as stay longer on your site. Internal linking also helps web spiders easily find, crawl and index pages. And when the internal linking is helpful and relevant for the user, it also helps the search engines understand the topic, and evaluate the quality. 
Another goal of internal linking is to help link equity to go throughout the website, thus increasing the ranking potential for each page. For example, links from the home page lead to categories; categories pages‚Äîproduct pages or a blog.
The last on-page ranking factor is the quality of technical SEO.
Internal website optimization includes many aspects such as no technical errors, having a robots.txt file and a sitemap. It is also very important to make sure that the website is designed for all device types and sizes, loads fast, and has a logical structure and helpful internal linking, etc.
So, let's take a look at the main on-page ranking factors once again:
Showing this text on the screen:
Content topic
Content quality
Internal linking
Technical SEO
Speaker says:
On-Page, you should focus on: Content topic. Content quality. Internal linking... and technical SEO.

Off-page ranking factors
Now let‚Äôs speak about the off-page ranking factors.
One of the factors that play a major role in off-page ranking is the number and quality of 3rd party websites that are linking to yours, or as they are also called‚ÄîBacklinks.
Popular sites, as a rule, have a lot of quality backlinks. Other websites often cite their content by placing their URL as the original source or provide a link to them as an additional resource for users. Inbound links have traditionally been one of the most dominant ranking factors that search engines take into account. Although their dominance is gradually falling as the algorithms become smarter, they remain a major focus in SEO.
Backlinks from relevant, authoritative websites have a positive effect on page rankings once they‚Äôve been discovered by crawlers. The main thing is to make sure that a page with links to your site is indexed and ideally doesn‚Äôt use the nofollow directive. 
The quality of backlinks is even more important than quantity. That‚Äôs why it is always better if the websites that link to you work in a related or similar niche. Search engines love organic links, but love  relevant organic links more!!!!.
The most effective backlinks are those that come from quality websites, in other words, they should be popular among users, provide useful information, and should not contain lots of ads. 
Another factor is Anchor texts.
An anchor is a text you click to move from one page to another, so it basically connects two different locations together. Ideally, the anchor texts tell search engines what the content on the destination page is about. Anchor texts are therefore an important factor. If an anchor contains relevant keywords it can positively affect the ranking positions of a web page for a particular query.
The next factor is User Experience or UX.
Search engines analyze a website through behavioural factors. How much time a user spends on a website, if a user stayed on a page or returned to the search results and continued with the same search, or if the user returns to a site from Google‚Äôs SERPs on multiple occasions. If users spend a lot of time on a website and return later, then the content can be considered valuable and useful.
Google also has a measurement called Core Web Vitals that attempts to measure the user experience on the page by looking at the speed with which the main content displays, how quickly the user can interact with the page and whether the content is visually stable. Once again, all aspects you should look to improve since they are things your users will appreciate as much as Google.
And the last ranking factor is the Click-through rate.
Click-through rate (or CTR) is the number of clicks that your website receives divided by the number of times your site is shown in the SERP (also known as impressions).
With these metrics, search engines can analyze how a user interacts with a website in the search results. 
A high organic CTR means that the snippet (the title and description next to the page URL) meets the user's expectations and catches their attention. This, in turn, has a positive effect on the position of the site in the future.
Now, let's summarize the main off-page ranking factors.
Showing this slide on a screen:
Number of backlinks
Quality of backlinks
Anchor text
User experience (UX)
Click-through rate (CTR)
Speaker says:
Off-Page, you should focus on: The quantity and quality of backlinks. anchor text. user experience... and click-through rate. 
Of course that list isn‚Äôt exhaustive, it is an overview of the main types‚Ä¶ There are hundreds of seemingly small factors within each that will affect ranking, but no one knows exactly how many there are nor exactly what they might be.  
the search engines provide recommendations, but the recommendations they provide affect only part of the SEO techniques - Google don‚Äôt want to give us all the secrets to their algorithm, that would make SEO too easy :)
In addition, search engines are constantly changing their ranking algorithms. Once again, your best strategy is to cover all the most obvious and important aspects as well as you can, and then to focus on providing a great experience for your users. 
Search engine optimization can help crawlers discover and index important pages, better understand and ‚Äúdigest‚Äù what you provide on those pages, and better appreciate that your content provides a better solution than that of your competitors. That‚Äôs why applying SEO techniques in accordance with key on-site and off-site ranking factors will increase your chances of making it into the top 10.
That‚Äôs all for today. I hope you‚Äôve learned a few things about SEO and are ready to move on to the next lesson, where I‚Äôll take a closer look at the Search Engine Results Page - often referred to using the acronym ‚ÄúSERP‚Äù."
Explanation of Link Building in the Context of Search Engine Optimisation	"I built my first website back in 1998, and over the years we got hundreds of thousands of backlinks, and by 2007 we were the 10,000th most visited site on the Internet‚Ä¶ a lot of that success was thanks to SEO, and a lot of the SEO success was thanks to backlinks :)

Right. Off we go!
What is a link?
Let's start with the basics and define what a link is.
Simply put, a link connects one web page to another.

As you know, the Internet is also called the World Wide Web. It's a MASSIVE network. Any network implies a multitude of things that connect to each other. In our case, web pages are things, or "nodes" if you are a bit of a geek, and links are the connections. Simply put, links build connections between web pages.
What is a backlink?
An important notion in SEO is a backlink. It‚Äôs simply a link to a page on your site from a page on another site.
In the context of backlinks, I‚Äôll be talking about link building, which is the process of encouraging other sites (3rd party sites) to add a link in one of their pages to one of your web pages.

Let me familiarize you with major link building terms.

Display the list:
Referring domain
Link juice
URL
Anchor text
Referring domain relevance
Referring domain geographical area



A referring domain is a website that contains a link pointing to a page on your site.
Link juice is a simplified definition of the ‚Äúvalue‚Äù that a link from one page passes to another. You might also hear the term ‚Äúpage authority‚Äù, which is very similar. The idea is that search engines look at ‚ÄúPage Authority‚Äù and a link from one page passes ‚ÄúJuice‚Äù to the other page. It‚Äôs important to remember that neither term is used by Google, but the concept can be helpful for us in SEO as a means to understand and measure, but that any evaluation is unreliable since search engines analyse links in a more complex manner.
You‚Äôre already familiar with the concept of a URL, which is the address of a page. One page can link to another by using the page‚Äôs URL. In the context of backlinks, we are interested in links from one site to another rather than links that are internal to one site.
In the On-Page SEO module, you already came across the concept of the anchor text. It‚Äôs a clickable text - when the user clicks on it, they go to a different page. The anchor text often describe what the target page is about. Anchor texts are usually highlighted with an underline and / or a color. 


Put the screenshot on the screen 

The anchor text itself is super important, but the wider context surrounding the link also plays a role. Search engines often focus on the anchor text itself, but also take into account the wider context of the surrounding text and where the  link is placed in the page. The fundamental thing they are looking for is that a link should always direct users to useful and relevant resources.

Most sites are dedicated to some specific topic. There are exceptions that have  `      content on practically every topic, such as Wikipedia, online magazines that cover all kinds of news, or social media platforms like YouTube and Facebook. But these sites are the  exception rather than the rule. A site linking out to you should be relevant to provide any benefit, which means its overall topic of the website should match or complement the topic of your website. It‚Äôs really only worth pursuing backlinks from such thematically relevant resources.
Websites are ranked differently depending on user location. For example, a website ranking #1 for the "car repair" search query for users in London won‚Äôt be in the top-10 for the same query googled in New York. That means you should focus on websites that are popular in your region and are geo-relevant to your audience.
Why do websites need backlinks?
Now that you have an idea of all the major link building concepts, let‚Äôs answer the most important question: why do websites need backlinks? 
Search engines try to provide users with the ‚Äúbest‚Äù, most helpful results, and a complex ranking algorithm measures thousands of factors to classify all search results accordingly. We looked at ranking algorithms in more detail in the lesson on ranking right back at the start of the course. Long story short, backlinks were a decisive ranking algorithm in the early days of the Internet, and they remain a powerful ranking factor today.  

One way to look at backlinks is that search engines count backlinks as ‚Äúvotes‚Äù. This works similarly to academic publications: a paper is considered good when it is cited by credible scientific journals and other research papers. That is, a work that is frequently cited by authoritative sources is considered to be expert and credible and therefore good quality. 

The same is true when it comes to websites: a large number of quality backlinks pointing to a page indicates that it‚Äôs high quality. But how do you evaluate ‚Äùquality‚Äù? Let's find out.
Backlink quality
Sensibly, search engines don't consider every link to be of equal importance. It makes sense: why should a link from Wikipedia be treated the same as a link from a Facebook comment by a self-proclaimed expert?
The most important aspect of backlink quality is that it should be natural. Search engines impose penalties for purchasing links and engaging in link schemes ‚Äî that‚Äôs when sites simply exchange links without caring about their usefulness or relevance. A penalized website may suffer a ranking drop or get kicked off the SERP altogether.

So, let's look at what links can be considered high-quality.
Referring website quality
Every site has a certain "value" to a search engine. This value can be measured in terms of credibility or authority of a site. Let's take Wikipedia as an example of a highly authoritative Internet source: when you search for general information, Wikipedia often appears near the top of search results. This is because the site is considered to be extremely credible for informational queries by search engines because of its long history, a huge number of backlinks, and high-quality content.

Looking at this example with Wikipedia, you might make the assumption that a credible website should rank well on Google, and that is indeed so. If you check Wikipedia‚Äôs rankings using SE Ranking‚Äôs Competitive Research tools, you‚Äôll see that the site ranks in the top-5 for a large number of keywords.

Share the screenshot:
 

Using the same tool, you can view the site's traffic data ‚Äî high organic traffic compared to equivalent sites also indicates that a referring website is of high quality and credible in Google's eyes.
Relevance of topics
We‚Äôve already agreed that the best backlinks come from websites that are topically, or semantically related to the site they point to. For example, if you have a car repair website, a link from a site about cats will be much less beneficial to it than a link from an online magazine dedicated to cars. 

If the site topics don‚Äôt match at all, search engines will find it difficult to understand the relationship built through the link, and the backlink will have little to no positive impact on your search ranking.
Anchor text types
A logical or informative anchor text is very important for link building.

I‚Äôll use Wikipedia as an example of a site that uses anchor texts properly. Within the article, anchors are used to provide more information about concepts that may need further explanation. Anchor text here serves to give users an idea of what they will see when they follow the link. For example, when clicking on a link with the text "World Wide Web," I expect to see a definition of the term. If a page meets user expectations, the anchor text was chosen correctly. 

Display the screenshot:



Depending on keyword use, an anchor text can be an exact-match, partial-match, generic or you may use a naked link. Let's take a closer look.

Display the list:

Exact-match 
Partial-match
Generic
Branded
Naked links




An exact-match anchor features a target keyword of the page it links to. For example, there‚Äôs a page optimized for the search query ‚Äúfurniture store austin‚Äù, and this exact phrase is used as an anchor text for a backlink pointing to that page. A link of this kind can bring a lot of value to the page, because it sends a strong signal to Google that the page is highly relevant for that specific search query. Still, you should be careful with exact-match anchor texts: when used too frequently with numerous repetitions of the same keyword across different backlinks, it will look artificial. This in turn can lead to search engine penalties.
A partial-match anchor text only partially coincides with the target keywords. It is a more "humanised" and natural type of anchor text. For example, instead of using ‚Äúfurniture store austin‚Äù as the anchor text, the site might use "where to buy furniture in austin". As a general rule, it‚Äôs better to use natural partial-match anchor texts and avoid exact-match keywords, which tend to look contrived and unnatural to the user .
In addition to the keywords in your target list, you‚Äôd expect to see anchor texts that contain generic phrases, such as "here," "click here," "on this website," "read more," and so on. 
Anchor texts often feature a company name ‚Äî they are called branded. This is a normal and desirable type of anchor text - people naturally link to other sites using the brand name.
Finally, sometimes, a link might be naked: that is it doesn‚Äôt have an anchor text at all, like here:
Display the text:
You can read more about this topic in the detailed guide by following the link: https://example.com/guide/


A good backlink profile should have a mix of all 5 types of anchor text: from exact-match to branded and naked links. Importantly, avoid building a large amount of links with the same exact-match anchor text. 
Geographic area
Now, let's continue to look at link quality indicators. The next one is a geographic area. A link to a page that targets the search query ‚Äúfurniture store austin‚Äù from a Philippine site looks   strange, both to humans and search engines. A link from an Austin based website is highly relevant and therefore significantly more valuable. As previously mentioned, also be sure to look for referring sites that cater to the same audience as your website.

A partial intersection of regions can also be beneficial if it makes sense: your backlink geography may include websites from neighboring countries that share a common language, for example: Canada and the USA, Germany and Austria. 
Link Attributes
To better understand the nature of every link, Google has set out clear rules on the use of additional attributes. If these rules are ignored, a referring site can get penalized. Since 2019, there are three main link attributes: Nofollow, UGC, and Sponsored. 

In the source code, the attributes look like this: 

Display the screenshot:


<p><a rel=‚Äúnofollow noreferrer noopener‚Äù aria-label=‚ÄúExample text (opens i
tab)‚Äù href=‚Äùhttp://example.com‚Äù target=‚Äù_blank‚Äù>Example text</a></p>

Let's look at what the specifics of each attribute are.

Share the list:

Dofollow
Nofollow
UGC
Sponsored


Dofollow is the default attribute that informs a search engine it should follow this link, visit the target page and consider this to be a ‚Äúvote‚Äù in the sense we saw in the earlier lesson. There‚Äôs no need to specifically add it to the link code. These are by far the most valuable links since there are no ‚Äúprovisos‚Äù as there are for the other attributes.
The nofollow attribute tells search engines to ignore a link, that is, not to follow it. This instruction is advisory by its nature ‚Äî the final decision whether to consider the link or not is up to the search engine. However, this way, a referring site indicates that it cannot guarantee the quality of the site it points to, thus decreasing the value of the link.
The UGC (user-generated content) attribute is used for links posted by site users. It is mostly applicable to links in comments, forum discussions, and so on. Thanks to this attribute, the search engines won‚Äôt hold the site responsible for poor-quality links posted by visitors.
As the name suggests, the Sponsored attribute is used for sponsored links. If a website has implicit or explicit commercial agreements with another business in exchange for the link, it should be marked with this attribute.

By using different attributes, and encouraging sites that link to you to use them, you can help search engines understand the connections between pages and avoid penalties for poor-quality links or link spam."
Explanation of Content marketing and content strategy in the Context of Search Engine Optimisation	"What is content marketing?
Content marketing is a set of techniques aimed at creating and distributing content that helps promote a business on the Internet.
The goal of content marketing is to provide useful and high-quality information to a target audience, about and around products or services. The idea is to directly or indirectly increase their value and attractiveness in the eyes of users, but also increase brand awareness, brand authority and trust in the brand. All of this helps to attract new customers and retain existing ones.
It‚Äôs worth noting that a company's content marketing costs are often lower than advertising costs. And yet the return on investment can be much higher.
Unlike other promotion channels, content marketing helps build short term communication and long-term relationships with the audience. What matters is not just the content quality but also the way it is presented ‚Äî the tone of the copywriting, or so-called ‚Äúbrand voice‚Äù.
Building long-term relationships by means of content is only possible when you have a content strategy. So, let's figure out what that is and how you can manage it.

What is a content strategy?
A content strategy is a blueprint for creating and publishing useful, high-quality content. It‚Äôs the foundation of content marketing.
A content plan helps you to be consistent in your communication with your target audience and also be strategic in how you inform them. For example, first, you might tell a bit about what your product is, then suggest some problems it might solve for them, then explain how to use it, then provide answers to frequently asked questions, and so on.
A good strategy uses multiple platforms and media to distribute content. This helps to better target different groups of users with a relevant message: for example, those who already use the product, or those who have heard about it but don‚Äôt use it yet, or those who do not know about it yet.
Let‚Äôs see what types of information you can communicate to your audience with the help of content.

Display the list on the screen and the voiceover reads the points:
1. Describe the value and benefits of goods or services
2. Tell them about the company or brand
3. Demonstrate your expertise and experience
4. Answer common questions
5. Share information that helps with the  purchase decision
6. Encourage the person to come back again

So, how do you create a content strategy? 
First, you need to decide on:

Display the list on the screen
‚Ä¢ Types of content to be created
‚Ä¢ Content topics
‚Ä¢ The length of the texts 
‚Ä¢ Publication schedule
‚Ä¢ Platforms for content distribution
Voiceover:
‚Ä¢ The types of content to be created (e.g. articles, social media posts, banner ads);
‚Ä¢ Content topics (what you will write about)
‚Ä¢ The length of the texts;
‚Ä¢ Publication schedule;
‚Ä¢ Platforms for content distribution.

The most important part of any content strategy is the content itself. To create high-quality and valuable content, you need to:

Outline the goals that you want to achieve with the help of the content. For example: increase brand awareness, tell your audience about a new product, motivate users to subscribe to a newsletter, or convince them to buy a product.
Study the target audience. Who are you writing for? What is the potential client interested in? What challenges does he or she face? How can they benefit from your content?
Study the competitors in the niche, estimate the strengths and weaknesses of the leading players, and use that information to figure out how to create even better, more engaging content than them.
Now let's look at the types of content that help promote a website and some suggestions for content placement.
Display the list on the screen
1. Content for the website.
‚Ä¢ Texts for landing pages
‚Ä¢ Descriptions of goods and services
‚Ä¢ Helpful articles 
‚Ä¢ Use cases of the customers
‚Ä¢ PDF guides
‚Ä¢ Engaging infographics
Voiceover:
1. A large portion of the content you create is going to be texts and images for your own site.
‚Ä¢ Texts for the landing pages are usually short texts that describe the company‚Äôs products and services or special offers with the aim of encouraging users to convert - subscribe to a newsletter, perhaps, or make a purchase. Landing pages always include CTAs or calls to action.
‚Ä¢ Then, there are pages with descriptions of goods and services.
‚Ä¢ And, blog articles that contain information that is helpful, valuable and relevant to the audience 
‚Ä¢ Some companies publish use cases that illustrate how customers use the products and services, and the benefits they bring to those customers.
‚Ä¢ Guides in pdf format are also a great option. They have high perceived value, so in exchange for the guide you can reasonably ask users to subscribe to your newsletter.
‚Ä¢ Another popular form of engaging content is infographics.

2. Then you‚Äôll also need Content for social networks. Most brands today have a profile on multiple social platforms: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, maybe even on Instagram, Pinterest and TikTok. To effectively communicate with users on social networks and expand your audience, you also need high-quality content. The content formats will differ depending on the specifics of each social network.

3. Another great channel of communication with your audience is video. Video content can be product reviews, tutorials, webinars, or even fullscale online events and marathon webinars.
4. People in your audience who like to do several things at the same time will appreciate the format of Podcasts ‚Äî with the help of podcasts you can share useful information that does not require visual support.
5. In addition to content for sites that you control, you also have to work on Third-party publications. Here you can create PR articles. The purpose here is primarily to increase awareness of your brand. But PR articles can also be used to explicitly inform users expl about your products and encourage them to buy. Importantly, articles you post on 3rd party websites will normally feature mentions of your company‚Äôs products, services, or blog articles... and ideally they‚Äôll contain backlinks to your site. Backlinks are an important part of any SEO strategy ‚Äî we‚Äôll discuss them in detail in a separate module of our Basic SEO course. And a quick tip: both for the users, the host website and for backlinks, it‚Äôs super important to publish articles on websites where your content will be relevant to their audience.  

Only medium-sized and large companies will have the resources to be able to consistently create quality content for all five types of content I just mentioned‚Äî in practical terms, you‚Äôll need a large team if you are to do all that well over the long haul. Smaller companies should realistically limit themselves to just a few of the formats that are most successful for them. But to understand which format works best in your case, you‚Äôll have to test different options.

Also, when creating content, you need to know from the get-go how you‚Äôre goi‚Äã‚Äãng to publish, distribute and promote it. After all, if no one sees your texts, images, and videos, there is no point in spending a lot of time creating them. The challenge of content delivery can be solved using appropriate marketing channels such as social networks, advertising, newsletters‚Ä¶. And, of course, SEO :) 

And an incredibly important point to finish this lesson: content that is well-suited to search engines, and optimised for them, will have a long ‚Äúshelf life‚Äù. Once that content is ranking, it will bring traffic to your site for months, and often years, with little or no additional investment from you. So it‚Äôs a VERY good idea to think about which content is a good fit for distribution through search engines, and build SEO into that content right from the start."
Explanation of Project Specifications in the Context of Search Engine Optimisation	"What is a project specifications document? 
Let's start with a definition. A project specifications document is a description of the customer's requirements for the contractor. The customer describes what kind of results he or she expects to get, and the contractor receives the necessary information about what exactly needs to be done and the rules and guidelines that apply.
If a contractor is next to you in the office, they can ask you a lot of questions as they work on the project. But what if they are working remotely? A detailed project specifications document with answers to basic questions helps save the customer's time and simplifies communication with specialist contractors, regardless of their location.

When is creating a project specifications document recommended? 
Project specifications documents are used for everything, from software development to banner advertising. In digital marketing and SEO, contractors are often copywriters, developers, and designers.
When is creating a project specifications document recommended?

Display the text:
To get new textual content
To have technical errors fixed
To get new design and UX elements implemented on a site 
To get new visual content 


When you need someone to write any kind of text 
In this case, the contractor can be a copywriter, an SEO-copywriter, or a content marketer for example.
When you need to implement technical SEO 
Such project specifications documents are created for a webmaster or web developer.
When you want to implement UX and design changes to the website 
These tasks can be performed by a webmaster, a markup developer or a web designer.
To enrich your texts with visual content, you‚Äôll also need to create a project specifications document 
Here, you‚Äôll be dealing with graphic designers.

How to create a project specifications document?
All  project specifications documents usually include a description of the project, the set objectives, the requirements, a set of guidelines and a timeline. They may also include references, style guides, and any other additional information that will help the contractor get the job done satisfactorily.
Let's look at the main components of a  project specifications document.
Display the text:
Project description should explain what needs to be done.
Objectives, which the task is supposed to achieve.
Requirements specify what the result should look like.
Timeline specifies when the project should be completed.
Guidelines, recommended resources, examples to follow and so on. 



Project description. The description should explain what needs to be done.
Objectives. The specialist must understand what goals the task is supposed to acheive.
Requirements. Specify what the result should look like.
A timeline (deadline). Specify when the project should be completed.
Additional materials. Guidelines, recommended resources, examples to follow and so on. 

SEO specialists will often need to deal with  project specifications document for copywriting based on the selected keywords. Let's take a look at how to write a project specifications document for a copywriter to get quality results.

Start with the Description.
What do you want to receive?
If you need an article, start by giving the contractor the topic. Here, you can specify either a ready-made version of the article title or just an approved topic from your content plan. 
What is the text about? 
The author must understand what to write about, and which points should be covered and discussed. 

Next, the Objectives.
Who are you creating this content for and in what context?
As a rule, the text on the site needs to address two issues: be useful to the reader and contain the necessary keywords for SEO. 
An absolutely essential point is to clearly define the target audience. Who will be reading the article? Who is the content aimed at? Are you talking to nature lovers or people planning repairs... perhaps young adults or parents? And be sure to identify the target audience‚Äôs level of knowledge. Do you need detailed content for highly skilled professionals or a high level overview for casual readers?
Next, it‚Äôs important to specify the Requirements for the text.
What should the result be? 
Here, you‚Äôll have to specify the technical parameters of the text.
The first is the Structure and outline. 
Headings, subheadings, numbered and bulleted lists make information more structured and that generally makes it easier to consume, understand and digest. If you have requirements or recommendations for the structure of the article and its visual design (pictures, layout, examples and so on), this is where you can specify.
If you already have a "framework" for the article ‚Äî a list of sub-topics that need to be covered ‚Äî add them to the project specifications document as well. 
You should specify the Length.
How long should the text be? Specify an approximate range for the number of characters or words. There are no clear rules about the proper length of content; so, you should be guided by the context, the topic and other similar articles that already exist.
Another important point is Uniqueness.
Generally, search engines want to show their users the original source. There are exceptions, but they will tend to rank websites that copy content from other sources less well and favour those that create original content. A good rule of thumb you might use is that quality copy should be at least 90% unique. In a project specifications document, you can specify certain tools that should be used to check the text‚Äôs uniqueness.

Having specified all the necessary requirements, define the Timeline or deadline.
This is an extremely important part of any project specifications document. Indicate the date when the contractor should deliver the finished task or the number of days the contractor has to perform the task. 

Don‚Äôt forget to include Additional materials in the project specifications document.
These can be links to sources of information on the subject that will be useful to the writer, a list of style guidelines, or similar articles that should be used as a reference.

A project specifications document for a copywriter almost always includes Keywords.
To create a text that will perform in search engines, it will need to contain relevant keywords. Beyond the keywords, providing a list of vocabulary that your audience naturally uses, that is relevant to the topic and helps clarify the context will help the writer immensely. The combination of keywords and relevant vocabulary is called a context cloud - JUST from seeing these words as a group, the copywriter should have a good idea what the topic and approach should be without needing to read your explanations.
Here‚Äôs an example.
Display a table on the screen:
Topic of the article 
"3 Reasons to Skydive"
Target audience
1) People aged 20-40 who want to try something new         
2) People looking for an original gift
Structure and outline
Make small chapters and in each chapter describe that skydiving: 
- gives new experiences; 
- raises confidence in one's abilities; 
- provides an opportunity to see nature from a bird's-eye view.
Uniqueness

Imagine that you promote a website selling unique experiences and extreme activities. To attract new users, they want you to write an article about skydiving in the context of an unusual gift. In the project specifications document, you will specify the topic of the article, the target audience, the structure of the article, and other requirements outlined  above. The link to the sample project specifications document file can be found in the description of the video.
That's it for this lesson. You learned the major points that should be included in a project specifications document for content specialists to ensure that they produce content for you that is high quality, on-topic and on time."
Explanation of Mobile optimization and responsive design in the Context of Search Engine Optimisation	"Why being mobile-friendly is important? 

The mobile experience on your website directly influences your business results and your website positions on Google.

First of all, if your website isn‚Äôt optimized for mobile, visitors may not find what they are looking for. They won‚Äôt place an order or call you. Instead, they‚Äôll just leave your website and find what they‚Äôre looking for elsewhere. To avoid this, you should make their experience as smooth as possible.

Second, in 2019 Google introduced mobile-first indexing. That means that the search engine evaluates your website based on the mobile version of your website. And that means your need to look at the mobile version of your site, without forgetting the desktop version, of course! Be careful: you need to look after both! Having different content on the mobile and desktop versions of your site may harm your rankings in some circumstances. It is essential that you allow Google and other search engines to crawl the mobile version of your website. Whatever you do, don‚Äôt block the mobile version of your website from search engine crawlers - otherwise they may not index your pages correctly. In future lessons, we‚Äôll elaborate on how you can control the crawling and indexing of your pages.

For the moment, I just want you to remember three main things. First, to rank high on Google, your website should have a responsive design that looks good on both desktop and mobile screens. Second, search engines should be able to crawl your website on any device and the content they find should be the same across the board. Third, your website should be well-organized and easy to navigate. If it‚Äôs not, neither users nor crawlers will ever see how good your content is.

The text is displayed on the screen:

Every second Google processes 40 000 search queries and 63% of them come from mobile devices



Let‚Äôs talk numbers. Just imagine, every second Google processes 40 000 search queries and 63% of them come from mobile devices. If your website doesn‚Äôt have a good mobile version, just imagine how many prospective customers you‚Äôre losing.

The chart is displayed on the screen:




The number of local search requests made from mobile increased 2 fold between 2014 and 2019.


Moreover, recent research has shown that the number of local search requests on mobile doubled over just 5 years. Over the same period, the number of searches on the desktop decreased by 6%. And that means webmasters should pay a LOT of attention to local SEO and mobile optimization.

The picture is displayed on the screen:





Just browse your website on a mobile phone. If you see that the text is too small to read, or images don‚Äôt fit on the screen, or design elements overlap, it means you badly need to optimize your website for mobile‚Ä¶ and the sooner the better!
Responsive design

First of all, I want to emphasize that Google recommends using a responsive design instead of creating a separate mobile version of your website. Opting for a responsive design means you‚Äôll have one website with pages that automatically adjust to different screens. Simpler for you, clearer for Google.

The animated picture is displayed on the screen:

First, the picture shows two websites with the following URLs: www.example.com and m.example.com then the second one disappears and www.example.com remains.




For example, instead of building and maintaining two separate websites www.example.com and m.example.com, you‚Äôll have only one www.example.com serving both desktop and mobile users.

Now, let us remind ourselves that users who open your website have a particular goal. They may want to order pizza or find your phone number. When optimizing your website for mobile, strive to make that goal easy to achieve.

The main rule is that your mobile visitors should see all the important information fast and need as few clicks as possible to get what they are looking for.

And if you make it easy on mobile, it‚Äôs likely to be even easier on desktop!
Check if your website is mobile-friendly

So how do you know what a visitor sees when browsing your website on a mobile device? You can simply use Google‚Äôs Mobile optimization checker to see. 

The screen record is displayed on the screen:





You‚Äôll need to open the tool and enter your web page address in the field. Then, click the Test The URL button.



In this example, the page has passed the test successfully: it looks good on mobile, all page elements fit in the mobile screen, and the text is readable.

You can also check out your website right in Google Search Console. There‚Äôs a dedicated report that shows whether your website works well on mobile. If anything goes wrong, the issues will appear in this report automatically and Google will include some suggestions for improvements. But let‚Äôs take each step as it comes: We‚Äôll talk more about Search Console Reports in a later module of our course."
Explanation of SEO Reporting in the Context of Search Engine Optimisation	"Optimizing a website takes a lot of time, effort, and patience, and when it comes to presenting the achieved results, it‚Äôs vital to make your report simple, yet comprehensive and detailed. A tough combination to get right, but I know we‚Äôll manage.

Right. Off we go!

What is an SEO report?
A report is an indispensable tool for any SEO specialist when it comes to communicating success to customers or managers. In fact, an insightful SEO report can be beneficial to practically everyone involved in a project, from marketers and webmasters to product managers and business owners‚Ä¶. and you! 

It gives you a chance to look back, analyze the data and see the big picture. Based on the insights provided by the report, it's relatively simple to understand the reasons for the project‚Äôs ups and downs, see how best to adjust strategy and find new untapped opportunities.

A great SEO report can help you with all these things. So, let‚Äôs look at how you can create a great SEO report. 
How to quickly generate an SEO report?
The most time-efficient way of creating a report is to make use of specialized SEO tools. If you use SEO software to handle all your projects, ideally it will be able to generate a detailed report for you in just a few clicks.
Dedicated, specialised tools can save you hours of routine work. Here I‚Äôm going to walk you through SE Ranking‚Äôs Report Builder as an example. 
There will be a screen record of the SE Ranking‚Äôs Report Builder, and we‚Äôll be demonstrating every point mentioned by the speaker:
All you need to start building a report with SE Ranking is to launch the Report Builder, hit the Generate a Report button, and choose the project you‚Äôre interested in.
Next, you need to set the date range and decide which data to include in your report ‚Äî I‚Äôll tell you which sections I recommend adding to the report in just a minute. Now, the SE Ranking Report Builder offers eight templates for you to choose from, and you can also build a custom report that contains only the sections you choose. You‚Äôll be able to include all the key data to the report, from website rankings to Google Analytics data and competitors‚Äô visibility. 
You can swap the blocks, delete sections that you don‚Äôt need from the templates, and add extra charts and graphs. And you can choose a custom design for the cover page.
The screen record ends, the speaker is shown on the screen:
Once the report is ready, you can save it to the platform, download it as a PDF document or send it by email ‚Äî to yourself, your client or maybe your manager. In the video description, you‚Äôll find a sample report generated using SE Ranking‚Äôs Report Builder.
To spend even less time on reporting in the future, you can save your templates and set up scheduled reports that will be generated and sent automatically to a list of email addresses you provide. 
And, of course, SE Ranking makes it easy to track your progress ‚Äî all your reporting history is easily available in the tool, so you can analyze how your results have changed over time. This is yet another reason to regularly create comprehensive reports. It gives you a chance to look back and see how your past actions impacted the project‚Äôs SEO. 
Which data an SEO report should have?

Now that we‚Äôve figured out how SE Ranking can help you quickly generate a report, let‚Äôs discuss in detail which data you need to add to an SEO report.

I recommend you start with a dashboard with the website‚Äôs key metrics. The exact metrics may vary depending on your goals, but as a rule, a ‚Äúkey metrics‚Äù dashboard should include information on traffic and conversion. This immediately gives an overview of how many people visited the site thanks to your SEO efforts and how many of these visits ended with a goal completion or target action. a ‚Äúkey metrics‚Äù dashboard will also normally include information about search engine rankings, technical health, and backlinks. 


Then each block of metrics should be presented in more detail on dedicated pages. 

Let‚Äôs discuss which data you need to include in your SEO report and why.  

I advise you to add data on website traffic as the first thing after the dashboard. You need to show how many visitors landed on your site from organic search and how your current metrics compare to historical data. 


Screen record shows a user adding the Traffic block to the report in SE Ranking‚Äôs Report Builder. In the block settings, the user chooses the Organic traffic section and shows that there are two options for comparison periods ‚Äî previous period and previous year. Then, the user chooses the Previous period option and hits the Save button. 
Voiceover

The SE Ranking Report Builder allows you to add data on a website‚Äôs organic traffic in just a few clicks. You can compare current data to the previous month or the previous year to evaluate your long-term progress.
In addition to general traffic data, you absolutely need to show analytics for separate website pages. 


Put the image on the screen


Voiceover
For example, you can add the five best-performing and five worst-performing pages to the report and add a note that you‚Äôre planning to work on the latter in the next months. On top of that, you can single out pages that have shown the best results over the past month. Or perhaps the pages that offer the best opportunities for the next SEO ‚Äúpush‚Äù.

The next block will include information on website rankings ‚Äî my advice is to select five to twenty target keywords for every website page you‚Äôre working on. This section of the report will show which rankings bring what amounts of traffic to the website. 


Put the image on the screen

Voiceover
Just like traffic, ranking data should be presented as a comparison. You can compare your current rankings to the rankings you had when the rankings were first checked ‚Äî which means compare now to the date when you started working on a project. Also, you can add a table with a brief ranking history to your report.

You can also compare your rankings to the rankings of your direct competitors ‚Äî that will show how your results measure against other players in the niche. 
Put the image on the screen



The next thing you can show is what has been done to strengthen your website‚Äôs backlink profile. You can add data on how many backlinks you‚Äôve managed to gain in a month, or since the start of the project, and perhaps indicate which pages are gaining the most links, and which anchor texts were used. 


Put the image on the screen

Voiceover
Use graphs to show the data in an easy-to-read format. Once again, because the results of your link building efforts can be slow, it‚Äôs better not to limit yourself to the data for the past month, but to analyze a longer period ‚Äî for example, from the start of the project or the three past months ‚Äî which will show a meaningful trend. It‚Äôs also important to check whether your older backlinks are still there and include this data in the report. 
Put the image on the screen


Voiceover
In addition to graphs, I recommend you add detailed information on every important backlink to the report. This helps stakeholders to understand the dynamics. SE Ranking‚Äôs Backlink Monitoring tool allows you to track a link‚Äôs status ‚Äî whether it is still active or if it was removed from the page ‚Äî along with other key parameters such as indexation status of the linking page, the domain authority of the website, and the anchor text of every link. These metrics allow you to evaluate the quality of each backlink and should demonstrate that your website has a healthy backlink profile that boosts your SEO. 

If you‚Äôve spent some time optimizing technical issues on a website, this should definitely be a part of your SEO report. 


Put the image on the screen


Voiceover
As you saw in the technical SEO module, indexation issues, broken links, improper redirects, a low Core Web Vitals score, and other technical problems can hold a site back in Google‚Äôs ranking. With the help of SE Ranking‚Äôs Website Audit, you can identify any issues and then add charts and tables to the report to point to weaknesses but also to highlight the work that you‚Äôve done.   
At the end of the report, you can add a section that will show how users interact with the pages on your website. If you spend a lot of time and effort on creating quality content, you need to make sure users like it. 
Put the image on the screen

Voiceover
Pay attention to how much time users spend on a page, whether they follow the links on your site or click any buttons. If your behavioral metrics are disappointing, add comments to the section and share your plans on improving the stats ‚Äî for example, if you want to improve content quality or the UX. 



6) One behavioral metric that really deserves a dedicated section is conversions. SEO traffic that you generate should bring profit to the business, which is only possible when users perform target actions on your site. Target actions may vary. Buying a product or a service, starting a free trial, clicking a partner link, or signing up for a promotion can all be target actions. They can all be tracked with the help of Google Analytics ‚Äî you just need to set up goals for every type of action that‚Äôs important to you. 

Put the image on the screen

Voiceover
Your report may feature data on the number of completed goals ‚Äî this could be the number of users who made a purchase or followed a partner link. Also, you can include data on the goal conversion rate such as the percentage of website visitors who performed the target action. 


In addition to the sections on the results you‚Äôve achieved, you can also add a block with your plans on further website optimization. Set out for yourself, your client or your boss what you intend to do in the next month or couple of months, and what results you hope to get. An important note here is that your plans should be based on the data in the current report. For example, if some of the pages have experienced a traffic drop, indicate how you intend to analyze the situation and perhaps also the changes you will be implementing.  

The best part about the Plans section is that it can be used as a reference for your future SEO reports - show that you do what you say you‚Äôll do, and what you do WORKS.

And then, right at the end, the summary ‚Äî a comprehensive report should definitely have a short summary! Graphs, charts, and tables can sometimes be understood at a glance and require no further explanation... but sometimes you need to provide more details. It‚Äôs better to add specific, focussed comments to every section and then summarize in the final section of the report. Here you can single out the most important data, briefly describe the major problems, highlight the best opportunities and comment on the key business metrics. 

Of course, the scenario in this video is not the only possible option, it‚Äôs just a suggestion. I would imagine in most cases, you‚Äôll have most of the sections I covered in this lesson on your report, but you can remove some, add others, swap the order, and shift the focus to the data that is the most important for you by adding extra details or leaving out data points that aren‚Äôt relevant. 

I suggest that you simply use this lesson as a reference to develop your own SEO report template that fits the needs of your specific project. 
And, as I mentioned right at the start, make sure you include the information that will help you to understand the effect of the SEO techniques you are implementing."

Explanation of Why You Should Optimise the Google Search Result for your Brand Name in the Context of Search Engine Optimisation	"It‚Äôs second nature these days to pull out your phone and search for a coffee shop when you need your next caffeine fix. Or, to type an address into Google to find directions. We don‚Äôt even print out maps anymore because Google is at our fingertips, waiting to provide us with the best route and live traffic updates. As users, we take Google for granted, expecting it to always be there with answers. Google is a response delivery service and it wants to provide its user, you, with the best answers. So, how does this impact business owners?
Because Google is your new business card.
Google provides the results people see when looking up your business. Whether it‚Äôs an existing client or a prospect who wants
     

     to learn more before taking the leap, Google is the go-to step in a person‚Äôs journey to finding your company. As such, Google‚Äôs representation of your brand is one of the most important brand messages they will see. Like it or not, the Google search result for your brand name is your ‚Äúdigital business card,‚Äù so it needs to be positive, accurate, and convincing for your audience. And to achieve this, you need to be proactive and take control. It might seem daunting, but the process is accessible for the average person, particularly when you employ a few simple ‚Äútricks‚Äù to get the job done.
While most business owners understand the importance of their online image, many still balk at the sheer scale of the web, complexity of the task, and seemingly indecipherable technical concepts involved. This book may cover many concepts and terms you don‚Äôt know (yet), and to help make understanding the content easier, I‚Äôve included a glossary, footnotes, and other reference materials to guide you. Managing your ‚ÄúGoogle business card‚Äù doesn‚Äôt have to be intimidating or complicated, and the benefits really do pay off big time.
An improved Brand SERP, the technical term for your digital business card, naturally leads to a significant increase in the control you wield over your wider online image. The whole process is easily manageable once you know the basic tactics, understand the crucial steps, and recognise the many acronyms associated with them. SERP is one such acronym.
SERP, or the Search Engine Results Page, is the web page you see after you enter a query into a search engine. When a user searches for a brand name, the search engine (Google, Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, etc.) shows them a Brand SERP, or the brand‚Äôs Search Engine Results Page. Online brand images



 function similarly for individuals and businesses. For the purpose of this book, we‚Äôll be looking at Google‚Äôs Brand SERP of your business.
The Brand SERP is a simple concept. But, like many topics with a clear premise, the devil is in the details and they add up to massive insights into your business, your digital strategy, and your audience. By addressing these small details, you‚Äôll build an improved business brand with a solid online strategy to better serve your audience. The key is to give due attention to each of these details, while also viewing them as effective pieces that improve the sum of the parts.
What is Google‚Äôs ‚ÄúRaison d‚Äô√ätre‚Äù?1
Google‚Äôs function is to provide solutions to user problems‚Äîit tries to provide the best information available online to fulfill a user‚Äôs needs.
There are three types of searches we all perform:
1. Informational
2. Navigational
3. Commercial (transactional)
For each of these, Google builds its SERP to try to best serve the intent of the user. Informational and navigational searches are the central two searches for your clients and prospects.2 When someone is seeking more information about your business, they will search your brand name with an informational intent to learn about who you are, what you offer, and if you are trustworthy.
1 Raison d‚Äô√™tre: (lit.) reason for being/existing. In context, what‚Äôs Google‚Äôs primary purpose?
2 If you are interested in the broader picture of different search intentions, read this additional resource from my friends at Yoast: https://yoast.com/search-intent/
   
     For a navigational search, the user already knows and is comfortable with your brand name, and they are looking to find your site. A navigational search occurs most often with well-known brands, such as Facebook. Even if you don‚Äôt have a Facebook account, you know what it is and you know what the site offers. By searching for Facebook, you are only looking to navigate to the site.
Brand searches on lesser-known companies, such as my business Kalicube, are more often informational in nature because the brand and services aren‚Äôt widely known. Google understands these different types of intents and knows which is most appropriate for your audience, so it builds your Brand SERP accordingly.
Google designs your Brand SERP to help users navigate to your site, find information about your brand, and access resources provided by your brand.
The entire internet strategy for your business stems directly from this one elementary statement. By understanding your Brand SERP and actively working to make it useful and valuable to your audience, you‚Äôll be building an incredibly solid, relevant, and effective digital strategy. However, very few business owners know how to get started, which puts them at a massive disadvantage. Google is the most comprehensible and helpful tool you have at your disposal to improve your business‚Äô brand. And ironically, it‚Äôs free.
Google is by far the dominant search engine on the internet. It holds 86% of the global market share and handles approximately 3.8 million searches a minute, which amounts to roughly 5.6


 This leaves other search engines, such as Bing and Yahoo, with a significant 14% of the global market share. To give you an idea of the vast scale of search engines, Bing serves search results to over a billion people every month (Clement). Since Google completes 5 times as many searches in just a day, the focus here will be on Brand SERP optimisation for Google. But remember, everything you do to improve your Brand SERP on Google will also help improve your Brand SERPs on Bing, Yahoo, and other search engines.
Internet searches are Google‚Äôs game, so Google sets the rules. Though, contrary to popular belief, if you take a proactive Brand SERP approach, you can lead the game by educating Google. It aims to understand who you are and what you offer, and it wants to learn about your business from you. Google may not be human, but it is an incredibly sophisticated network of algorithms and is capable of learning.
Google is essentially a child trying to understand your brand message so it can accurately and fairly represent your brand to your audience. It‚Äôs your job to educate Google using online content associated with your brand. Every time you add or change content on the web, Google reads and digests the information, and it learns more about who you are and what your brand is. This is where you lay out the ground rules and control your Brand SERP. If you provide a consistent message across all digital platforms, over time, Google will gain a better understanding of your brand and provide more accurate, relevant, and helpful information about you to its users.
With so much at stake, you cannot ignore Google‚Äôs SERP for your brand. Many users looking for information about your business won‚Äôt look beyond the SERP itself. Users are looking for


     convenience, and Google packages up a summary of what it knows about your brand and provides this information on your Brand SERP. Since Google is essentially a reflection of the world‚Äôs opinion of your brand, you need to ensure your brand is represented correctly.
When you search ‚ÄúJason Barnard,‚Äù you‚Äôre met with this:
Google recognises me as the leading expert on Brand SERPs or ‚ÄúThe Brand SERP Guy,‚Äù and it presents the photos I want it to show. But these results are not just good luck. I studied the search engine and established how to educate Google so it correctly understands me and my personal brand, and represents the brand message I define. I didn‚Äôt start with a big dream of demystifying Google.



 Software as a Service (SaaS) platform, Kalicube Pro. Kalicube Pro is the semi-automated, data-driven, pragmatic approach to Brand SERPs.
Kalicube Pro started as a set of tools I created to help me help my clients. It has now grown to become the go-to platform in the world for agencies looking to improve Brand SERPs for their clients, and an industry insights dataset containing 70,000 brands, over 10 million Brand SERPs, and a total of 200 million data points (‚ÄúKalicube Pro‚Äù).4 Kalicube Pro analyses a snapshot of your Brand SERP and uses a set of proprietary algorithms to establish where the underlying issues are, what needs to be improved, and which strategies will be effective.
Kalicube Pro is imagination applied to data; it combines pragmatism with creativity to gain insights into your Brand SERP, and provides strategies to leverage maximum benefit for your business.
Alongside the platform, I realized some clients needed a more in-depth understanding of the strategies and the reasoning behind them, so I recorded a series of video courses in 2019. In these videos, I walk the audience through the steps of managing their Brand SERP.
In all, I provide three levels of instruction:
1. This book covers the fundamental theory behind Brand SERPs.
2. The Brand SERP courses explore the pragmatic approach for invested business owners.

     3. Kalicube Pro provides a data-driven bespoke tasklist to enable brand owners to take their Brand SERPs to the next level.
As you can see, the resources I offer have grown as my understanding of Brand SERPs has deepened and expanded.5 All of these resources have one common theme: if you don‚Äôt proactively feed it information about yourself, Google will make up its own mind based on the fragmented, often inaccurate information that it pieces together from around the web. This hodgepodge conclusion could show your audience an unrepresentative reflection of your brand based on what Google thinks is true. When it comes to business, you don‚Äôt want to leave your brand‚Äôs message to chance, so you need to proactively manage your Brand SERP with clear intent and determination. You need to educate Google.
By controlling your Brand SERP, you own the narrative of your brand and keep your potential clients focused on an accurate and convincing depiction of you.
Brand SERPs are the inescapable reality of our digital world. They provide the first, virtual face-to-face impression for your potential clients, and first impressions can be hard to overturn. By controlling your Brand SERP, you own the narrative of your brand and keep your potential clients focused on an accurate and


 convincing depiction of you. For prospective clients, a good Brand SERP means a shorter path to conversion, higher conversion rates, and better client retention. For existing clients, it means better client engagement, easier upsells, and fewer clients leaving you for the competition.
My mantra on Brand SERPs is straightforward and no-fluff, much like the process itself:
A good Brand SERP is good for your bottom line. A great Brand SERP is great for your bottom line.
Your brand is your biggest asset in business, so you need your Brand SERP to represent it accurately. But more than that, your brand is an entity. When it creates your Brand SERP, Google
     


     looks at your brand entity, not at your website. Your website is informative, but it‚Äôs just one representation of your brand. Google is trying to understand the brand itself and determine the overall brand message portrayed online.
Business owners often see Google as an intimidating, complex force that‚Äôs in control of their online business success. But this is your Brand SERP, your brand message, and you are the one in control.
There are many tactics at your disposal to take control of your Brand SERP, the most effective being:
‚Ä¢ Optimising
- Your Homepage
- Rich Sitelinks
- Google Ads
‚Ä¢ Improving
- Other Search Results (ones you control and those you don‚Äôt)
- Your Social Media Accounts
‚Ä¢ Employing
- Simple SEO Tactics ‚Ä¢ Avoiding
- Cutting Corners with Cheats


 Your starting line is the current impression your Brand SERP projects to your audience when they Google your business. Take a look at your Brand SERP now and ask yourself:
‚Ä¢ What do I see?
- An inaccurate message? A lack of compelling language?
‚Ä¢ What did I expect to see?
- More relevant results?
- Your Twitter page, third-party corroboration, positive reviews, etc.
‚Ä¢ What do I want to see?
- Your brand dominating the search? Results that
convince users to choose your brand?
- Impressive third-party articles, 5-star reviews, social media platforms, etc.
Once you see the gaps and flaws, you can start to correct Google‚Äôs understanding of your brand and ‚Äúdesign‚Äù your Google business card, ensuring it positively reflects you and convinces your audience to do business. Your Google business card displays the world‚Äôs opinion of you to your audience searching for your brand, so you need it to be as polished and convincing as your CV when applying for a job. The ‚Äújob‚Äù here is landing the customer, and your Google business card is the CV they see.


     Since your Brand SERP is a reflection of the world‚Äôs opinion of your brand, it‚Äôs essentially an executive summary of your digital ecosystem. Your digital ecosystem consists of your site, your social media presence, the content you create and distribute, public feedback from your audience (including social media and customer reviews), and any third-party statements about your brand. Understanding the digital ecosystem of your brand starts with the Brand SERP, and you can easily
build a solid ecosystem outwards
from there. As you work through
your digital ecosystem, you‚Äôll
see your strengths, correct your
weaknesses, plug the holes,
improve your reputation, refine
your brand message, and own
your narrative.
In the ensuing chapters, this book covers the ‚Äúwhy, what, and how‚Äù of every major aspect of Brand SERP optimisation. So please, read on."
Explanation of Why Jason Barnard Started Working on Brand SERPs	"Curiosity drove my research and led me to a deep understanding of how Google builds the Brand SERP and how it evaluates brand credibility.
A little background history: I graduated with a degree in economics and a minor in statistical analysis from Liverpool John Moores University. Then, I launched my first site in 1998, which is the same year Google was incorporated. Google and I kind of grew up together‚Äînot that Google has noticed!
I‚Äôve been optimising content to perform well on Google since almost the very beginning of search engines on the internet. My first website was UpToTen, which offered educational games and activities featuring the cartoon characters, Boowa and Kwala. By 2007, the site was welcoming 5 million visits a month‚Äîa stunning 60 million total for the year 2007. 20% of these were organic visitors from Google searches. I realised I was able to dominate the SERP for generic queries like ‚Äúkids games,‚Äù ‚ÄúK-12 activities,‚Äù and many more.
But I noticed there was a piece missing and business owners, myself included, were only doing half of the job. I had established a following for UpToTen, but when users searched the names to learn more, the results were not what I expected nor what I wanted. Google was getting my Brand SERP wrong.
So, I decided to figure out how to change the results being shown and help Google get things right. I Googled my name and was met with results on approximately 250 Jason Barnards from around the world: myself, a footballer, a dentist, a podcaster, a hockey player, a university professor, some other digital marketers, and still more. I realized I could use my skill set of dominating the Google search results for generic terms to intentionally control the results for my own (brand) name.
  


     I had completed the hard part of using SEO to build a following for my site, but like most companies out there, I hadn‚Äôt stopped to consider what users see when they search for the brand. If you‚Äôve successfully captured the user‚Äôs attention, your follow-through has to convince the user to continue. This involves the intentional optimisation of your Brand SERP.
I started with a ‚Äúsilly trick.‚Äù One of the results was about my work in the 1990s as a musician. I played with the punk folk rock group, The Barking Dogs, and we did cover versions of several songs. One such cover was ‚ÄúAce of Spades‚Äù by Mot√∂rhead. I provided this information to Google using some SEO techniques (see Chapter Six for SEO tactics) and Google ‚Äúpicked up‚Äù the information about me playing bass for our cover ... and presented me as a musician in the original band! I‚Äôd added content of me playing the song and Google deduced that I was the bassist for Mot√∂rhead.



 This was a comical test, but it does reveal an important point about Google‚Äîonce Google accepts you as a trusted authority on you and your brand, you can ‚Äúfeed‚Äù it information with relevant content.
Here are some examples of how I have educated Google about myself:


        After my initial experiments, I realised brand owners can and should be educating Google about their businesses and brands. Brand SERPs in particular needed to be explored more for maximum business optimisation. My goals going forward were to:
‚Ä¢ Make all references to me positive, accurate, and convincing
‚Ä¢ Dominate the page results to ‚Äúown‚Äù my SERP
‚Ä¢ Prompt Google to show Rich Elements on my SERP3
As I began to master this process, I gained clients who saw my work and wanted to make changes to their own results. They saw the value of owning the brand narrative on their Brand SERP as I have successfully done. Working as a freelancer, I helped many brands over the next eight years. In 2015, as my client base grew, I professionalised my operations by founding Kalicube, honed my ‚Äútrade‚Äù of Brand SERP optimisation, and in 2021, launched a
3 SERPs feature Rich Elements, such as a Knowledge Panel, Twitter Boxes, Image Boxes, Video Boxes, etc."
Explanation of Optimising Your HomePage in the Context of Brand SERP Optimisation for Google and Bing	"As an established businessperson, you‚Äôve probably invested hundreds or even thousands of dollars to make an attractive and professional website for your visitors. The next obvious step in Search Engine Optimisation is making the site attractive to search engines so potential clients can find you on Google and Bing when they are looking for products and services like yours. Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) is an incredibly important strategy for your long-term online success. But before jumping with both feet into a massively ambitious SEO project, you need to do some foundational work first, such as optimising your homepage to secure the reputation benefits offered by a great Brand SERP when people Google your brand name.
Your homepage should appear at the top of your Brand SERP. It‚Äôs the most appropriate response for a search of your brand, and Google can easily make that association. By making your homepage attractive to your audience on the SERP, you are ensuring their perception of your brand is already positive even before they navigate to your site or research your company more
  

     deeply. This is crucial since the people Googling your brand name are the most important people to your business: prospects and clients.
There is an exception to the rule ‚Äúyour website should rank #1 for a search on your brand name.‚Äù Unfortunately, if you‚Äôve established a business under an ambiguous brand name, or if you share your brand name with other companies, you‚Äôll have some competition for those top results.
Take ‚ÄúYellow Door‚Äù for example. A door can be yellow and it‚Äôs the name of several businesses: Yellow Door (Books and Resources for Early Years Learning), Yellow Door (Jewelry shop), etc.


 That said, even with an ambiguous brand name, you can still use the following tactics to improve your Brand SERP.
The Meta Title and Description
A big part of your control is over the meta title and description. Meta title refers to the title you provide Google in the HTML (the blue hyperlinked title in the result). You can think of the meta title as the most basic education you give Google.
   As you can see above, there‚Äôs limited space for your meta title. Google only gives you about 60-70 characters, so each letter must be perfect and deliberate. My business‚Äôs meta title is very precise and includes the name (Kalicube) and what I am offering (tools to help with Brand SERPs) in a way that draws the user‚Äôs attention. Use the meta title to describe your brand and overall service being

     offered, as I‚Äôve done. Try to include your unique selling point, but if it feels like a stretch, save it. The last thing you want to do is overwhelm your reader (client or prospect) and discourage them from visiting your homepage. The person is explicitly looking for you, so always start with your brand name and build the meta title from there.
As a whole, your meta title should be positive, informative, clear, and convincing. Use words that will emotionally resonate with an audience who already knows at least a little about you. You want to impress prospective customers and reassure existing clients in your limited space. Naturally, refining your meta title will take a few rounds of development and edits to create the most effective result. As your business grows and changes, be sure to update your meta title and description as needed so it continues to provide the best representation of your brand.
As an example, Amazon updated their own meta title for the first time in 17 years in June 2021. As you would expect, it was a move that their marketing department extensively researched, and the change was for a good reason: to create a more effective message to clients and prospects Googling their brand name, right at the top of their Brand SERP. For 23 years, the title emphasised sales and promotion as ‚ÄúAmazon.com: Low Prices in Electronics, Books, Sports...‚Äù The update changed it to ‚ÄúAmazon.com: Smile More, Pay Less.‚Äù The new title places Amazon‚Äôs brand front and center. The fundamental message conveyed on their Brand SERP is how the brand resonates with people searching for their brand name. I would like to imagine this change was influenced by my work on Brand SERPs. Is it a coincidence that Amazon made this change in 2021, a year I declared ‚Äúthe Year of the Brand SERP‚Äù? Perhaps. But allow me to dream.

 Whatever Amazon‚Äôs official motivations are, this new title is a massive shift and clearly conveys a human message that charms prospects, reassures clients, and provides the core benefits of their brand upfront. The change also shows that Amazon is no longer trying to sell right from the SERP. The focus is 100% on their brand message and brand image, making this an eloquent example of the correct approach to Brand SERP development.
Business optimisation is the end goal for these digital strategies. Since Google shows the meta description right below your meta title, it should expand on the message and follow the same approach: be clear, convincing, and on-brand. Bear in mind, the reader is a prospect or customer who already knows at least a little about you, so you have to project a resonating, clear brand message.
In order to do this, you need to utilize every space available. It‚Äôs absolutely necessary for you to provide a meta description, otherwise Google will choose a section from your page. And that can be a disaster! Take a look at the example below and see the difference in quality for a description written by the company versus what Google will generate.

     Don‚Äôt let Google run wild. Help it by providing a description that promotes the most important and relevant aspects of your brand, including who you are, what you do, and who your audience is.
Ideally, your description should be between 160 and 200 characters. If the description you provide is too short (less than 100 characters), Google will automatically select a description from your page, and it may not be on-brand. If your description is too long, Google will truncate it and some of your message will be lost.
The meta description is the place to make your first selling point. Clearly outline what‚Äôs unique about your brand and convince the reader to continue to your homepage. The language needs to build curiosity, indicate the importance of your brand, invite your reader in, and clarify the topic. It‚Äôs not easy, but if you spend time on this task, you can convey an enormous amount of information in one short sentence.
In some descriptions, you‚Äôll see the brand has included references to customer reviews. Reviews can reassure potential clients and establish your credibility. Only include reviews if they accurately articulate your brand and unique selling point; otherwise, these reviews will lack the sufficient substance needed to convince your potential homepage visitors.
I know it‚Äôs a lot to pack into 40 words (a 60-character title and 200-character description). Take your time to get it right‚Äîit‚Äôs easy to write a compelling paragraph about your business but much harder to craft a powerful, comprehensive sentence. As Mark Twain said: ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôd had more time I‚Äôd have written less.‚Äù1
1 This quote is based on a translated letter written in 1657 by Blaise Pascal, French mathematician and physicist: ‚ÄúI have only made this letter longer because I have not the time to make it shorter.‚Äù It has been repeated in various forms by Mark Twain, John Locke, Martin Luther, Henry David Thoreau, and many more.

 The meta title and description are important suggestions to Google about the content it should show its users on the SERP. When they are well written, representative of your brand, and helpful to your audience, Google will generally use your suggestions. However, bear in mind that Google has the final say, so it may choose to show different content in the SERP. All the more reason to spend time getting your metas right so you maximise the chances of Google using your message rather than creating its own.
  Optimisation for Multi-Homepage Companies
If you are in charge of an international brand with multiple homepages or the same homepage but in different languages, you need to ensure your brand is consistent across the board.
Include equivalent resources and aim to incorporate the same ‚Äúbuzzwords‚Äù you use to describe your brand, adapted to the relevant language and culture. It‚Äôs important to reflect the same brand image despite the language and cultural differences. Direct translations can convey an inaccurate message, so a native speaker should review your business homepage for every location.
For your brand to succeed, you need to establish a uniform message internationally‚Äîboth for your consumer‚Äôs sake and for Google‚Äôs ability to understand your brand.

     The Homepage Promise
Once your meta title and description attract the reader, your homepage needs to deliver on the promise. The majority of people landing on your page are going to fit into one of two categories: existing clients and prospective clients. Your existing clients will have a specific need they want to find answers to, so you need your website to be clear and easy to navigate.
Your prospective clients are assessing your offers and your credibility. They want their questions answered and they want to be convinced you‚Äôre the right solution. Your content needs to clearly express the solutions you are offering, explain your services, and assuage any doubts they may have. The overall goal of your homepage is to adequately address the needs of the people who want to do business with you‚Äîcurrent clients and prospective ones.
When you‚Äôre designing your homepage and prioritising content, bear in mind what falls ‚Äúabove the fold.‚Äù Unless people are engaged and invested, few will scroll down on a page for more information. Therefore, you want to make sure the top part of the page is perfect: put the most relevant and convincing content above the fold. If the top is catchy and informative, it may be enough to convince a site visitor to explore your site more and learn about your service/product.
Your homepage is crucial. It is a page like no other. A special case. Treat it as such.

An up-to-date and fresh homepage is key to maintaining a positive impression with existing and potential clients. It is a massive signal to Google that you are working to improve user experience and actively building your brand.
Since prospective clients will see your homepage when they are on the cusp of making the decision to do business with you, and existing clients will see the page again and again, it is well worth spending time to make it absolutely perfect. An up-to-date and fresh homepage is key to maintaining a positive impression with existing and potential clients. It is a massive signal to Google that you are working to improve user experience and actively building your brand.
Remember, your homepage is never the final destination for your site visitors‚Äîit‚Äôs a stepping stone to other pages on your site. As such, you need to ensure you have an easy-to-navigate site for users to find the sections and pages on your site they are looking for. If your website proves frustrating to navigate, you may fail to convert prospects and possibly lose some existing clients too. Your homepage is a crucial place to reassure your ‚Äúbrand-aware‚Äù audience and introduce yourself to newcomers.
Once your homepage has been enhanced for a high-quality user experience, you can transition to optimising sitelinks to further improve your Brand SERP."
Explanation of Optimising Your Rich Sitelinks in the Context of Brand SERP Optimisation for Google and Bing	"Optimising your homepage is the single most important and easy-to-implement improvement for your Brand SERP. But if you want to provide a positive experience for your audience on your Brand SERP, the next step is to develop Rich Sitelinks under your homepage. ‚ÄúSitelink‚Äù is the technical term for the hyperlinks to website subpages. On a Brand SERP, these sitelinks appear under the homepage and are designed to help users navigate to specific pages on the brand‚Äôs site. Take a look at the Brand SERP for the grocery chain, Aldi:

     Aldi‚Äôs Rich Sitelinks include quick navigation to their featured deals, list of products, careers, and the option to coordinate grocery pickup and delivery. These links provide an improved user experience on the Brand SERP, and by making the shopping process easier, Aldi may have secured more sales simply through their sitelinks.
Sitelinks that Address the User‚Äôs Needs
Google includes three essential types of links in the sitelinks of a Brand SERP:
‚Ä¢ Navigational
- Contact Us
- Client Login
- Store Locator, etc.
‚Ä¢ Informational
- About Us
- Blog
- Terms of Service, etc.
‚Ä¢ Commercial
- Pricing
- Special Offers
- Products
- Services, etc.
These links address the different reasons most users search for a brand name. By placing these links on your Brand SERP, your


 clients can obtain the information they are looking for without taking a detour through your homepage. This direct access from the Brand SERP is surprisingly powerful, especially since it improves the user experience.
For Kalicube, the sitelinks look like this:
   Here, Kalicube directs users to the Kalicube Pro SaaS Platform, a presentation of the company, information on Brand SERPs, and an easy way to contact us. For both prospects and existing clients, this is a great Brand SERP user experience.
Without sitelinks, a potential client is likely to skim right over your business‚Äôs homepage and move onto your competition. Users are looking for information and convenience. They don‚Äôt want one without the other, and Google is aware of this. Within your own Brand SERP, you should work to ensure that Google includes Rich Sitelinks, since this will encourage more traffic to your website.
  

     A Rich Sitelink refers to an expanded version of your sitelinks. This includes the blue link text and a description (called a snippet). My example sitelinks are considered Rich Sitelinks because they provide some context for the users without the need to click and navigate. Because of their nature, Rich Sitelinks have some basic pros and absolutely no cons:
Pros
‚Ä¢ Easy for you to get.
‚Ä¢ Easy for you to influence.
‚Ä¢ Helpful for your audience.
‚Ä¢ Gives you control over more SERP real estate.
‚Ä¢ Provides you with more text to project your brand‚Äôs message.
Cons
‚Ä¢ You only have influence over sitelinks, not control. But, if you follow the tactics outlined in this book, there are no disadvantages to sitelinks.
As you can see, there‚Äôs a lot to gain with no risk involved in developing Rich Sitelinks, and having them will vastly improve your overall Brand SERP.
Astonishingly, only about 50% of brands have Rich Sitelinks on their Brand SERP. Therefore, Rich Sitelinks are an easy way for your brand to stand out from the competition. This low-effort task will give you a competitive advantage and these sitelinks provide a highly visible place for you to expand on your brand message.

 Your homepage meta title and description only allocate about 40 words, whereas with Rich Sitelinks, the number increases by well over 200% to about 100 words. You can use the extra space to present to your clients and prospects cherry-picked positive and helpful representations of your brand and services. In addition, people using your Brand SERP to navigate can click your sitelinks to go directly to the page they‚Äôre looking for without stopping first at the homepage. Nothing says opportunity like convenience.
Google is all about convenience, and it understands the value of its users having direct access to different site pages via sitelinks. Therefore, Google will provide sitelinks whenever it can. Sitelinks act as both a representation of Google‚Äôs understanding of your website and also key contributors to the success of your Brand SERP.
Facebook is an excellent example of a brand with successful sitelinks. When users search for Facebook, Google clearly understands the user and the site, and it includes Rich Sitelinks that offer clear navigation for Facebook users and business owners looking to connect with those users as consumers:

        Right away, Facebook sets itself above the competition by providing user-friendly navigation on its Brand SERP. Your business won‚Äôt have Facebook‚Äôs extensive reach, but Rich Sitelinks work the same way for every business‚Äîthey make life easier for your audience and help make your business the obvious choice.

 There are several reasons to curate Rich Sitelinks:
1. They‚Äôre above the fold, so they‚Äôre seen by everyone who searches for your brand on Google.
2. They provide an extended brand message.
- You influence the links.
- You control the content.
3. They help your audience.
- Sitelinks improve navigation, which creates a positive user experience.
4. They look professional.
- Lacking Rich Sitelinks looks unprofessional and unconvincing.
5. They dominate the top of your Brand SERP.
- With Rich Sitelinks, you control the top 30% to 40% of your Brand SERP, whereas without them you control 10% at best.
6. They ‚Äúkill off‚Äù blue links.
- Rich Sitelinks take up more space, which pushes the less relevant results in the Brand SERP to the next page.
Including Rich Sitelinks will give you an edge over competitors since they improve the user experience while also communicating your brand message to potential clients. The more Brand SERP results you influence or control, the better brand representation you get and the fewer distractions there are for your existing clients.


     Rich Sitelinks are High Priority for Brand SERPs
When a user searches for something, Google‚Äôs algorithms determine the most relevant and useful pages for the user. Google processes a user‚Äôs geolocation, search history, type of device, etc. to provide the results best suited for each particular user. As you can see below, even a brand name as straightforward as ‚Äúyellow door‚Äù will have very different results in the US compared to the UK.
   Google analyses its users, your brand, and the interactions between the two so it can provide the best results. By creating Rich Sitelinks, you‚Äôll be giving Google more fodder to inform and help your audience, which includes the essential information about your business: who you are, your office/outlet locations, employee profiles, recent articles, reviews, company calendar, how people can interact with you, pre- and post-sales, FAQ, etc. Behind these sitelinks are informational pages that are often forgotten by business owners, but are absolutely vital for both consumers and Google.

 It‚Äôs a win-win-win situation‚Äîthe consumer has the ease of navigation, you increase your control of your brand message, and Google gets the opportunity to represent you correctly.
One incredibly important aspect of your website is how you organise and group pages. This is important for every aspect of your SEO strategy, including Rich Sitelinks on your Brand SERP. Google‚Äôs ability to produce relevant and helpful sitelinks depends on its understanding of the role each page plays and the solution it provides to the user. The content of the page is evidently crucial, but where the page appears within the structure of the site is also essential and often overlooked.
The technique you need to employ for organising your pages is called siloing. Much like silos on farms, website content silos refer to stacking or organising the material vertically by type and topic. In the context of websites, siloing makes sense for humans and also makes processing information on your site easier for Google and will vastly improve your chances of getting Rich Sitelinks on your Brand SERP.
Despite the intimidating term, creating silos is simple, and the final product looks like this:
‚Ä¢ https://words.com/topic1
- https://words.com/topic1/sub-topic1 - https://words.com/topic1/sub-topic2
‚Ä¢ https://words.com/topic2
- https://words.com/topic2/sub-topic1
  

     With silos, Google can collect the information in your site more easily and their algorithms can digest the information more effectively. This means Google will better understand who you are, what you offer, and who your offers are pertinent to. When completed correctly, siloing will enable Google to provide the best possible Rich Sitelinks, which will improve your Brand SERP. But intelligent, logical, and systematic siloing will also improve your overall SEO strategy.
Once you have siloed them correctly, how do you optimise the pages themselves for Rich Sitelinks? There are three major optimisations you need to apply to each page to make it a good Rich Sitelink candidate for your Brand SERP.
Firstly, write descriptive meta titles and descriptions. The rules here are similar to those for the homepage. Be accurate, clear, and concise. The title and description are shorter (less than 30 characters for the title), so you‚Äôll need to be even more concise than you were for the homepage. It‚Äôs important to note that since the homepage title and description already contain the brand name and communicate the overarching brand message, these sitelink titles and descriptions merely need to describe the role of the page and why it might be helpful to the user.
Secondly, include a paragraph in the page itself that is visible to the user and describes the role of the page. This might seem pointless for a page such as ‚ÄúContact Us.‚Äù However, friendly and encouraging text is great for the user and is one of the most important aspects Google takes into account when choosing Rich Sitelinks.



 Finally, some technical improvements help enormously. The details of these are outside the scope of this book, but your web developer can help you: ask them about web page subtypes in Schema Markup such as the ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù and ‚ÄúContact‚Äù page.
Many of the pages that naturally appear as Rich Sitelinks on Brand SERPs, such as ‚ÄúLogin,‚Äù ‚ÄúContact Us,‚Äù or ‚ÄúAbout Us,‚Äù are ignored in a typical SEO strategy. This is the correct practice because these pages generally only appear for brand searches, and SEO strategies usually prioritise non-branded search terms. This means you can focus on making those pages perfect for their exclusive role as sitelinks for your Brand SERP.
Your homepage and sitelinks are results you control, and they are the easiest and most visible way to improve your Brand SERP quickly.
The pages you use to drive traffic in your wider SEO strategy (such as product pages, category pages, blog articles, events, etc.) should continue to be optimised for that purpose. It really isn‚Äôt possible to optimise for Rich Sitelinks on Brand SERPs and SEO for non-brand search terms at the same time. Therefore, it‚Äôs illogical to optimise these pages for sitelinks and ‚Äúkill‚Äù money-making SEO strategy traffic for the sake of a slightly better Rich Sitelink. Instead, rely on a great meta title, meta description, and quality content. As long as those are all relevant to your brand, the Rich Sitelink on your Brand SERP will look pretty good.
  


     Your homepage and sitelinks are results you control, and they are the easiest and most visible way to improve your Brand SERP quickly. But improvements to your Brand SERP aren‚Äôt always quite so straightforward.
After developing your sitelinks, you can begin building your social media profiles, which appear on your Brand SERP and are partially in your control."
Explanation of Why Social Media is Important in the Context of Brand SERP Optimisation for Google and Bing	"Social media is ubiquitous. It is a massive, ever-evolving ‚Äúbeast‚Äù with users of all ages and backgrounds. As such, a social media presence is crucial for business success, regardless of the products and services you offer. The key to social media is choosing the right platforms. You need to choose sites with the right demographics‚Äîplatforms where your audience naturally gathers and engages with each other. For example, LinkedIn for B2B, TikTok for GenZ, Pinterest for a B2C audience, etc.1
Consider ‚Äúmom and pop‚Äù shops. Most often, they don‚Äôt use social media, and their business comes from a steady stream of locals and some customers who are just passing through the area. These businesses have a limited reach, and as a result, they have a limited consumer pool. This approach works fine for ‚Äúmom and pop‚Äù shops, but if you‚Äôre looking for a wider consumer base or prominent business presence, then you need to integrate social media into your business strategy.
1 B2B, ‚Äúbusiness to business,‚Äù is a company that provides services to other businesses.
B2C, ‚Äúbusiness to consumer,‚Äù is a company that sells directly to individual consumers.

     Every business (including ‚Äúmom and pop‚Äù stores) can benefit from a presence on relevant social platforms. An active social presence is a great tactic to reach new audiences in a strategic way. Some business owners may dismiss social media as trivial and unnecessary, but social media platforms are an incredibly powerful marketing tool and have a major presence on Brand SERPs.
Social media‚Äôs influence can‚Äôt be ignored. Over 3.96 billion people, or about 51% of the world‚Äôs population, use some form of social media to connect with others, entertain themselves, or gather information (‚ÄúSurprising Social Media Statistics‚Äù). The majority of social media users participate daily on their favorite platforms.
On average, social media profiles occupy over 30% of the real estate on a Brand SERP, and 5 of the top 10 sites on Brand SERPs are social media platforms (‚ÄúKalicube Pro‚Äù). If you have social media accounts, even semi-dormant ones that you rarely update, you need to manage them intelligently since the profile pages of those accounts are very strong candidates for ranking on your Brand SERP.
Be aware that these social media profiles are trickier to manage than your own website. Since you are restricted by the rules and requirements of the platform, you only have semi-control over the actual content of your profile page. Furthermore, you only partially control what happens on social media, and you have no control over how your audience interacts with your content.
 

 The Aspects within Your Control
In terms of what Google displays on your Brand SERP, your direct control is limited to the title of your business profile and the description of your brand. This varies slightly depending on the platform, but generally the system is the same. Make sure you review what the different platforms display on your Brand SERP, so you can optimise the information on your social media profiles accordingly. Note that the information Google displays beyond the title and description can include many elements such as the number of followers, reviews, the date of the most recent activity, and much more."
Explanation of Social Media is Important in the Context of Brand SERP Optimisation for Google and Bing	"The Bonuses of Social Media
At a basic level, social media is an easy win for your Brand SERP. Profiles on multiple platforms are a great way to have control over relevant content beyond the scope of your homepage. There is no absolute rule, but brands can have 2, 3, or even 4 social profiles displayed on their Brand SERP. Combined with your homepage and Rich Sitelinks, this means an immense amount of control over what your audience sees when they Google your brand name. Every aspect of your account matters‚Äîfrom the posts you make to the people you follow to the colors in your profile. They all contribute to your overall brand message.
And there is a massive bonus. By working on your social presence and publishing relevant, compelling content, not only will these platforms become a permanent fixture on your Brand SERP, but the people you are engaging with on those platforms are much more likely to visit your website to learn more about your products and services. For myself, Kalicube, and our clients, we have found that an active social media presence improves the Brand SERP and also brings in new clients directly from those platforms.
These days, many businesses hire someone specifically for social media marketing/content management. Google may not know if you hire someone dedicated to creating content, but it will judge the value of your content and consider whether or not it‚Äôs a valuable and helpful resource for users. If you want a particular social media account to rank on your Brand SERP, then, once you have optimised the profile itself (always the first step), direct your energy to making the account attractive to users and Google. This isn‚Äôt a set-and- forget effort, but a process of creating relevant content that intrigues your audience and then actively interacting with them. Once your
  

     profile starts ranking on page 1 for a search of your brand name, your Brand SERP will look better and encourage your audience to visit your social platforms, thereby creating a circle of mutual benefits between social media, your brand, and Google.
Now the question becomes: ‚ÄúWhich social platform is relevant for me?‚Äù For gaining visibility on business social media accounts, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and LinkedIn are the more effective sites. Some of this depends on your audience, industry, and country; however, most often these social media platforms are easy opportunities because they‚Äôre relevant for the people who Google your brand, and Google knows it. Even if your company‚Äôs profile has limited activity (which I do not recommend), a profile on one of these platforms will often rank because of its relevance to your brand, your industry, and the natural strength of these platforms in Google‚Äôs eyes.
The dominant social platforms on your Brand SERP will not necessarily bring you the biggest ‚Äúclient bonus.‚Äù Industry-specific sites can provide a larger and more loyal following with the trade- off being that you reach a smaller audience. It‚Äôs best to build your profiles across a number of social media platforms in order to increase your visibility and Brand SERP.
But what about the other platforms such as TikTok, Tumblr, or Pinterest? These can be incredibly powerful in some industries and regions, but they can also be a waste of time if your audience does not naturally congregate there. For whichever platforms you think are the most appropriate for your industry, it is vital to do some research about them first. Make sure you are leveraging the right platforms for your audience, industry, and geo-region before you invest time and resources into specific platforms. You can look at the Brand SERPs for your competitors and see which platforms

   dominate to get an idea of where to spend your time. At Kalicube, we automatically track this for our clients and offer insights into which platforms dominate in their industries and country, and what strategies will work in their specific cases.
Since every company has access to social media and the majority of people in the world actively use these platforms, your business will greatly benefit from using social media as a marketing tool. You‚Äôll be generating new business while improving your Google Business Card!

 Putting Your Profiles into Action
Social media removes the boundaries of physical borders and provides your business with the chance to build a wider audience base as you connect with interested parties. Social media platforms are dominated by mobile users, which is a big plus. People use social media on their smartphones more naturally and easily than they will use your site. Whether they‚Äôre standing in line for coffee or ignoring people on the metro, many people are constantly reading on their phones. You have a massive opportunity to grab their attention when they are on the go, and this habit provides you with endless possibilities to create content while you are on the go. I cannot emphasise enough how important it is to take full advantage of your reach and appeal to the audience you have as well as potential consumers.
Be sure to focus on people who will be truly interested in your offers. Appealing to people who find you irrelevant is a huge waste of time and resources; it‚Äôs better to have a small, highly relevant, highly engaged social audience than a vast audience that never interacts with you.
So, what should you do? Don‚Äôt just talk about your business, services, and offers. Instead, make sure the majority of your content is helpful and enjoyable for your audience. Concentrate on starting conversations with your audience about topics they are interested in using videos, audio, and images (memes and GIFs in particular), and creating opportunities for audience participation.
If you‚Äôre in the auto business, a social media post could ask people to comment with their favorite cars, either from movies or ones they themselves have owned. It‚Äôs a little silly and won‚Äôt directly lead to sales, but interactions that invite further engagement will


     increase brand awareness, improve the perception of your brand, create a larger audience reach, and tell Google that your account is a valuable resource for people searching your brand.
Likes, comments, and sharing posts build your credibility with Google and create more content for Google to include on your Brand SERP. That‚Äôs not to say your posts should all be playful or off-base; they should relate to the products and services you offer, but do so in an interesting and inclusive way. Take a look at these prominent companies and how they encourage interaction with their Twitter and Facebook audiences:



    The content you create needs to function on multiple levels. It needs to captivate and inform, and the medium itself needs to be varied, which means including rich media such as GIFs, images, and videos. Videos are a particularly effective format since they are multi-purpose; they can be repurposed as images, sound, text, or used in their original video form. Think about it: when you scroll through social media, do you stop to read the paragraph of text, or do you pause at the brightly colored image with giant text on it? Social media is meant to be visual; some platforms rely on it more than others. Instagram and YouTube are all about the visuals, so it‚Äôs a no-brainer. Twitter and Facebook are more text-based, but users often include videos or photos. In almost every case, text- only posts get less attention and participation than the ones with images or video.

     From a business perspective, by focusing on rich media on social media, you‚Äôll build a solid social presence while naturally providing a solid, powerful digital ecosystem, which will trigger Rich Elements on your SERP that are more enticing and convincing than plain text.


    Although social media profiles only offer your business semi-control over the results, the platforms‚Äô capacity for engagement means they are easy to retain on page 1 of your Brand SERP, and they are a positive representation of your brand over which you have a great deal of influence.
From a Brand SERP perspective, actively working on multiple relevant platform profiles helps Google get a better sense of your business and brand message. With more information to pull from, Google is able to represent your brand better, as well as understand where and when you can provide value to its users. Although social media profiles only offer your business semi-control over the results, the platforms‚Äô capacity for engagement means they are easy to retain on page 1 of your Brand SERP, and they are a


     positive representation of your brand over which you have a great deal of influence. Social media is not guaranteed to rank, but after your own site, they are the most reliable candidates for your Brand SERP and provide indispensable benefits. Beyond social media platforms, you should also explore other online spaces; though most only offer partial control, they can still contribute to your Brand SERP and help you reach a larger audience."
Explanation of Optimising Google Search Results You Partially Control in the Context of Brand SERP Optimisation for Google and Bing	"Results you only partially control or you don‚Äôt control at all (see Chapter 5) are a double-edged sword; they can either earn you extra credibility with your audience and Google or create confusion about your brand and its message.
Any content that is accurate, positive, and corroborates your brand message is a positive signal for your audience. This is true for your own content and your social profiles, as well as results you do not directly control. These results can add credence because they are independent from your brand and offer an outsider‚Äôs perspective on your business. Google recognizes these impartial, third-party results and values them more because of it, making them great candidates for your Brand SERP. Since Google‚Äôs bottom line is the user experience, it wants to select the most trustworthy brands for a user‚Äôs SERP. Users trust Google as unbiased and independent, so its representation of your brand is vital for the credibility of your business.
  
     The flip side is that if the content is inaccurate, it causes confusion and uncertainty. These less-than-favorable results will create a negative impression for Google and its users. Because Google and your audience perceive these results as independent, they can be challenging to remove. If the results are inaccurate and you can change them or have them changed, then the priority is to improve the results as much as possible. If the results are negative and you cannot have them corrected or reworded, then you will need to push those unwanted results off page 1 of your Brand SERP page and down and out of sight on page 2.
Users trust Google as unbiased and independent, so its representation of your brand is vital for the credibility of your business.
To create your Brand SERP, Google merely synthesizes and reflects the world‚Äôs opinion of your brand. So naturally, a positive online presence will yield a positive reflection on your Brand SERP, and negative noise around your brand can easily sour your results. Public perception of your brand is vital to your business success, so it‚Äôs essential you land and maintain positive mentions from third- party sites.
Some of the results you may have limited control over include:
‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢
Informational Sites
- Wikidata, Crunchbase, Wikipedia
Industry-Specific Sites
- Organisations and associations relating to your industry
  42


 ‚Ä¢ Commercial Sites
- Amazon, eBay, etc.
‚Ä¢ Media Sites
- Such as websites where you‚Äôre a guest blogger or contributor
‚Ä¢ Review Platforms
- Yelp, Google, Trustpilot, Amazon, Glassdoor, Indeed
As you analyse your Brand SERP, identify which third-party results boost your brand‚Äôs image and which ones are negative or confuse your brand message. You should make changes to improve these results to the extent the platform allows you to. If the result is positive but slightly imperfect, tweak it. If the result is negative or confusing, correct it if you can.
But be warned: you could fall into a potential trap of inadvertently ‚Äúwaking up‚Äù bad results. By updating these unwanted results, you ‚Äúwake‚Äù them and make them more timely. This will encourage Google to retain them, or worse, push them higher up your Brand SERP. If you cannot make the result positive, accurate, and convincing to your audience, then you should leave it alone and work to improve the results below it. You can push them up the Brand SERP, thus pushing the bad result down. This technique is called ‚ÄúLeapfrogging.‚Äù
     
43

     Work your way through the sites where you have partial control and see where you can make improvements and where you need to push the result to lower pages. The Kalicube course, ‚ÄúDealing with Negative and Sub-Optimal Results,‚Äù explains the Leapfrogging technique and how to address the results you need to bump down to a lower page, but for now, let‚Äôs focus on the results you can improve.
Addressing the Results You Can Improve
You need to ensure that informational sites provide accurate content about your brand since your audience and Google will use these sites to learn basic information about you and to better understand your brand. Some of the top sites are Zoominfo, DnB, Wikidata, Bloomberg, Crunchbase, and Wikipedia. They are default choices for doing preliminary research, and an inaccurate or negative representation of your brand on sites like these can ruin your Brand SERP and perhaps cost you a customer.
Informational sites will sometimes appear on page 1 of a Brand SERP but more often on pages 2 and 3. This means they are generally less visible than your own website and social profiles. As you review these sites, make sure the information is accurate, positive, and complete. You should include links to your own website and social media accounts, both to ensure that Google understands the resource is about your brand and also to encourage users to visit your pages. If you have the option, edit the meta title and description. The meta title should be kept brief with just your company name, a short synopsis of your brand, and the site name.

 Unlike the other sites, Wikipedia is not an option for most companies. Basically, unless you are a recognised innovator in your industry, you don‚Äôt ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù a page on Wikipedia. Creating your own page is a fool‚Äôs errand. If the human editors on the site judge you as insufficiently ‚Äúnotable,‚Äù your page will be removed within two weeks. If your company already has a Wikipedia page, you can make minimal edits, such as adding references and correcting inaccurate information. For the most part, you‚Äôre not supposed to edit a Wikipedia article, especially one where you are a biased party.
Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and, as a rule of thumb, should only contain pages about entities that a significant number of users would spontaneously research. Further, it deals in facts only, and your page will be removed if the editors determine that it is not of real value to Wikipedia users, or if they believe it has been edited with a biased viewpoint. If you want your own Wikipedia page, take the time to build your digital ecosystem and online presence first. Being recognised as an authority in your industry by an independent third- party site or authoritative sources will make your brand ‚Äúworthy‚Äù of a page, according to Wikipedia‚Äôs standards.
Profiles on industry-specific sites are great candidates for ranking on a Brand SERP and are an ideal way to create results you partially control in addition to your social media profiles. In many ways, these sites are ‚Äúbetter‚Äù for your Brand SERP than dominant platforms since Google perceives industry sites as highly relevant to your audience and are therefore quite valuable to include on your Brand SERP. Despite their smaller reach, these sites still carry influence in Google‚Äôs eyes due to their topical relevance.
  

       Examples of Industry-Specific Sites and Social Media Platforms
Lawyrs.net: A social media platform for lawyers to share legal updates and create international referral networks.
ResearchGate.net: A collaboration platform for scientists to share their projects and research and get feedback from other experts.
Sermo.com: A US-based online physicians community that addresses topics from patient care to practice management to medical advancements.
LinkedFA.com: A social networking site for financial and insurance professionals and investors.
ActiveRain: The largest international social media platform for real estate professionals.

 Don‚Äôt Overlook the Influence of Industry-Specific Sites
There are 3 reasons to integrate more industry-specific sites into your digital ecosystem:
‚Ä¢ They rank well today.
- Because they‚Äôre relevant to you and important to your audience, Google prioritises these sites for inclusion in a Brand SERP even over generalist sites such as Crunchbase or Wikidata.
‚Ä¢ They will rank better in the future.
- Google is focusing more and more on topics, ontologies, and categorisation, so these sites will carry more and more weight as time goes by.
‚Ä¢ They are a powerful corroboration for Google.
- Google uses the information on these sites, and because they are topically relevant, they really help Google gain confidence in its understanding of who you are and what you do.
Although not always very ‚Äúsexy‚Äù for your audience, these additional sites can provide you with a ‚Äúcontrol cushion‚Äù on your Brand SERP: multiple results on pages 1-3 where you have partial control to keep less positive (and possibly damaging) results out of sight on pages 4 downwards.
  
47

     Limited Control with Commercial Sites and Reviews
Commercial sites where your brand has a profile page only offer limited control because your brand is operating under the umbrella of a larger company. Take Amazon and eBay for example: they tend to prioritise their brand over yours even though they are selling your products. For these sites, you typically can‚Äôt control a great deal in the meta title or description, but you can choose which products are featured for your brand. I generally don‚Äôt recommend trying to have this type of site on your Brand SERP, unless selling through them is a major part of your business strategy.
Other sites with profile pages for brands can offer you some control. An example of this type of site would be if you‚Äôre posting articles on a third-party blogging platform or news outlet. Much like commercial sites, these sites typically offer limited control and will tend to prioritise their brand name over yours. The amount of control you have will vary from site to site, but if you have some control, use it to project a consistent brand message.
Review platforms tend to rank well and easily on Brand SERPs because Google knows most shoppers consider the reviews of a company before they make a purchase. Google will try to rank what we call ‚Äúservice reviews,‚Äù or pages that collect reviews about the quality of a company‚Äôs customer service, rather than pages with reviews about the company‚Äôs products.
Review sites are a big source of angst for many companies due to the lack of direct control. But if your customer service is top-notch, there‚Äôs no reason to be scared of them. You do not have direct control, but you can heavily influence how they look on your Brand SERP.
  48


 In general, if a customer is satisfied with a product or service, they are unlikely to leave a review. It‚Äôs the outliers, those who are exceptionally satisfied or dissatisfied, who leave their feedback. You can counter this tendency and turn review sites into great credibility signals for Google and your prospects by encouraging all of your satisfied customers to leave a positive review on these platforms. Simply include a candid request in post-sale emails: ‚ÄúHappy with our service? Please leave us a review on Trustpilot,‚Äù and include a link to the review page for your business. If you are a bricks and mortar business, you can suggest clients leave a review, or even give them a flyer with step-by-step instructions explaining how to leave a review. As a rule of thumb, you should be aiming for an average review score of 4.5 out of 5.
Popular company review sites include Yelp, TrustPilot, BBB, and Tripadvisor, but there are also many industry or country- specific sites that, because of their topical relevance, can often be better ‚Äútargets.‚Äù Look at the big players but also seriously consider these niche review platforms since they are highly relevant to your industry and your audience. You can start by prioritising any review platforms that currently rank on the first 2 to 3 pages of your Brand SERP, since these are the ones Google currently considers important and they are the most visible to your audience. You can also look at your competitors‚Äô Brand SERPs to see which review platforms rank for them. If Google sees them as relevant for your competitors, they are likely to be great candidates for your Brand SERP too.
  
49

     Here are two examples of highly relevant review platforms:
        50


 Job sites with employee reviews, such as Indeed and Glassdoor, are another type of review platform that easily ranks on Brand SERPs. Unfortunately, reviews on these sites can be outrageous and wholly inaccurate, and because you are dealing with current and ex-employees, it is a delicate task to overtake bad reviews with good reviews. It‚Äôs one matter to ask for a review from satisfied customers: explicitly asking an employee for a great review is tricky and can easily backfire. As a rule of thumb, 3.5 out of 5 is a good average score for employee reviews and it is difficult to score higher.
Generally speaking, I don‚Äôt recommend trying to change these results even if they are unflattering or negative since it is unlikely you will succeed. A better approach is to use the Leapfrogging technique I mentioned earlier to push these job sites down the rankings and out of sight, preferably to page 3 or below. Reviews from former employees can negatively impact your Brand SERP and should therefore be monitored.
     

Cultivating an online presence is more complicated than creating a user-friendly homepage and attractive social media accounts. Your Brand SERP reflects Google‚Äôs evaluation of your online presence, and the bigger your company grows, the more important a diverse digital ecosystem becomes for your Brand SERP.
A larger digital ecosystem means more results have the potential to appear on your Brand SERP, and while most are entirely or partially in your control (social media, review sites, and your own website), some results offer you no control at all. However, even when you have no control over results linked with your brand, you can still take measures to improve the results."
Explanation of Improving Search Engine results You do not control in the context of Brand SERP Optimisation for Google and Bing	"Now let‚Äôs take a look at results over which you have no control. Whether they are positive, neutral, or negative, they all require your attention. Content from relevant and authoritative third parties tends to rank well on your Brand SERP because Google values the independent assessment of the brand.
It‚Äôs every business owner‚Äôs dream to have a great article from a trusted and authoritative source ranking on the Brand SERP. Praise from a third-party source will feel like acknowledgement for a job well done, but the alternative scenario is a nightmare: seeing an inaccurate, negative representation from a third-party site in plain view of your audience when they search your brand name. Here, it may feel like a moment to despair and throw in the metaphorical towel, or worse, to angrily strike out and try to discredit the publisher. Instead, the best strategy is to calmly approach the source: the author of the negative mention. While content from third parties does tend to rank well on your Brand SERP and you can‚Äôt control its presence, you can appeal to the person behind the review.

     Your Brand SERP only contains about a dozen sources or less, and these are the most influential web pages about your brand (both for your audience and for Google).
With any third-party content, you want to work to get the meta title and description to be as good as possible so the result is positive, accurate, and compelling on your Brand SERP. Ideally, you also want the content in the page to be positive for your brand, not only because people may click on the result and read the content of the page, but also because Google pays particularly close attention to third-party mentions of your brand. Since you have no direct control, you need to appeal to the owner of the site to modify their content. If the result is positive but the title and description on your Brand SERP could be better, then your aim is to get the author to improve them. If the result reflects negatively on your brand, you can try to convince the person to tone the message down to a more neutral response.
Approach with Caution (and Class)
For results outside of your control, you can‚Äôt storm the author‚Äôs inbox with your demand to make changes. Think about it. Even if you knew the person behind the content, you wouldn‚Äôt dream of asking a professional favor that way. Improving these third-party results (positive or negative) requires strategic action on your part. Before anything else, you need to establish a relationship with the third-party author.

 Like any relationship, it‚Äôs important not to rush the process, so make a genuine attempt at building a connection with the author. By far the best way to start is with an introduction by a mutual acquaintance. This approach gives you a great kickoff since a mutual acquaintance will give you credibility in the eyes of the author. Rather than having a metaphorical ‚Äúfoot in the door,‚Äù the door will be held wide open for you. Of course, this isn‚Äôt always an option, in which case you‚Äôll need to establish a relationship on your own merits without a recommendation to elevate you. The question is: ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù
If you cannot get a personal introduction and recommendation, the next best way to approach the author is in person. While this may seem a little aggressive to some, in an online world that leans towards detachment, a face-to-face meeting is increasingly powerful. When you talk to someone in ‚Äúreal life,‚Äù you have the chance to be much more than a two-dimensional online profile and make a good impression on them. This method is especially effective if you and the author attend the same type of events, such as industry brunches, conferences, and workshops. In this context, the introduction is more natural and has a greater chance of success since it allows you to strike up a conversation and establish a connection before you ask them for your favor.
If a personal connection isn‚Äôt an option, either through a mutual acquaintance or face-to-face introduction, then reaching out on social media is your best bet. First, ensure your profiles are professional and articulate your business‚Äôs brand‚Äîvisiting your profile will be the person‚Äôs first move before they decide whether to interact with you. The relationship is tenuous (at best), so you realistically have just one chance to ‚Äúget your foot in the door.‚Äù
  

     When you do reach out, the author will likely look at your profile, so you need to ensure they see the best possible version of you.
LinkedIn is often the most suitable option for reaching out because it has a massive focus on professional relationships. When you connect on LinkedIn, it is a good idea to add a personalized note to your request, assuming you have an interesting subject for the recipient. If you can‚Äôt think of a genuinely worthwhile message, send nothing with your connection request.
Whatever you do, avoid directly talking about your Brand SERP problem. A first message with a ‚Äúpitch‚Äù candidly asking the author for a favor is not attractive and puts pressure on the person, which makes it easy for them to ignore you. At this point, the idea is just to get your name and face on their radar. The discussion about your problem comes later.
If the author is also active on Twitter or another major platform, follow them there too. It‚Äôs important not to overdo your efforts and come across as overly persistent or downright creepy. Be reasonable in your expectations for this connection: you‚Äôre a stranger, and the author doesn‚Äôt owe you anything. Give the author time to respond and start a conversation. Once you‚Äôve chatted back and forth a couple of times, then you can ask for your favor.
There‚Äôs no definitive ‚Äúright‚Äù time to approach the author with your favor. You have to ‚Äúread the room‚Äù and get a sense of whether the author will be open to your request or will find it pushy or impertinent. Remember, this author‚Äôs mention of your business is a part of your Brand SERP, and you can‚Äôt improve the mention without their help.

 If you rush the connection or offend the author, you‚Äôve lost your best chance. You are going to ask this person for quite a big favor, and people generally don‚Äôt do favors for strangers. You need to build a relationship before you ask.
There‚Äôs an Art in Asking
Then, when you do finally ask your favor, you need to phrase it in a way that engages them. Most often, this means outlining the changes as mutually beneficial. They have to feel comfortable in the relationship and see the value the change will bring them. Some people will help out of the kindness of their hearts. This is the exception, not the rule. Most often, people don‚Äôt want to expend energy without some kind of benefit in return.
Consider the two email approaches below:
1. ‚ÄúHello, my name is Jason Barnard, and I tell people how to make their Brand SERPs better. I‚Äôm pretty well-known and the work I do is pretty revolutionary.‚Äù
2. ‚ÄúHello. Your recent article about SEO tactics and using social media platforms has generated a great discussion about my work with Brand SERPs. Thank you for the positive mention. The article currently ranks incredibly well on searches for my brand name, which is really favorable for my business. Perhaps we could chat about how we can make your article work even better for both of us.‚Äù"
Comparison of Two Different Approaches to Improving Third Party Content in the Context of Brand SERP Optimisation for Google and Bing	"Consider the two email approaches below:
1. ‚ÄúHello, my name is Jason Barnard, and I tell people how to make their Brand SERPs better. I‚Äôm pretty well-known and the work I do is pretty revolutionary.‚Äù
2. ‚ÄúHello. Your recent article about SEO tactics and using social media platforms has generated a great discussion about my work with Brand SERPs. Thank you for the positive mention. The article currently ranks incredibly well on searches for my brand name, which is really favorable for my business. Perhaps we could chat about how we can make your article work even better for both of us.‚Äù
  
     There‚Äôs a distinct difference in these two approaches. The first example is very egocentric and uses what I call an ‚ÄúI, me, mine‚Äù approach. That‚Äôs how most people naturally speak and write, but communicating with others from this point of view is a big turn- off and can be isolating and off-putting. Most people get tired of being talked at and react more positively to being talked to. If you‚Äôre asking a favor, you need to put yourself in their shoes and pivot from egocentric to empathetic if you want to make your request appealing to the author.
The second email attempt places the emphasis on the other person right from the start. You mention their work and thank them for the positive mention. From there, you mention the effects of the article and propose making some uncomplicated, mutually beneficial changes. This approach shows the link between them (their article) and you (your brand). By including ‚Äúwe‚Äù in the final sentence, you create the idea of a mutual bond, perhaps even a team spirit, for moving forward.
Here‚Äôs another set of examples:
1. ‚ÄúI think your article gives a great overview of what Kalicube offers. We recently updated our product specs, so please update your article accordingly.‚Äù
2. ‚ÄúYour article gives a great overview of what Kalicube offers, and you have sent quite a few happy customers our way over the last year. On behalf of the entire team, thank you. I should mention that we updated our product specs last week, so the information in your article is no longer 100% up-to-date. Could you spare a little time to chat so I can share the details? Please let me know if this is possible and, if so, when would suit you. Looking forward to chatting with you.‚Äù


 The first is a fairly typical message, but it‚Äôs unlikely to succeed. Yes, you mention their article, but you reference the article only in relation to your work. Once again, the emphasis should be on the author and their company, not you and your business. The request to update the information is direct, bordering on being too blunt while also managing to be dry and unoriginal. The final example makes more sense and is significantly more likely to be successful.
Here, you start with a positive mention about their work and continue with how it has helped your relationship. At this point, you have made them feel good about themselves and you have created an implied relationship. Now, you can naturally indicate that the article is no longer accurate and suggest chatting to update the information. In most cases, content like this doesn‚Äôt qualify as a misrepresentation of the truth‚Äîthe article information is merely outdated and inaccurate now, which is something most authors would want to remedy. In the email, you acknowledge that their article and positive mention brought you business while gracefully voicing your request. The request demonstrates flexibility and awareness of the time the author would sacrifice to update the article. The friendly tone is engaging and conveys an authentic desire to connect and build a relationship. This email doesn‚Äôt guarantee a response, but the approach will vastly increase the likelihood of hearing back from the author.
An obvious faux pas in this situation would be to try and use a template email. We‚Äôre all guilty of trying to save time by copying and pasting the exact language we‚Äôve successfully used before into a new email and then changing some details to make it ‚Äúpersonalised.‚Äù Your Brand SERP contains only a dozen sources or less, and these are the most influential web pages about your brand (both for your audience and for Google). Don‚Äôt try to cut corners here because
  

     this favor, if accorded, will bring a hefty positive boost to both the audience‚Äôs and Google‚Äôs perceptions of your brand.
As with any professional favor, you need to make your request relatable, relevant, and open. You can follow a loose structure, but the email shouldn‚Äôt feel stiff or rehearsed‚Äîit should be unique and address the person, their point of view, and allow them some ‚Äúwiggle room.‚Äù Since each case is unique, if you want your message to be compelling, your approach needs to be personalised. You only have one shot at establishing a connection with the author, so take the time to do it right.
Once you have established a relationship, you need to convince the author to make changes to their representation of your business. To achieve this, you need to demonstrate the value the changes will bring them (directly or indirectly).
When reaching out, keep in mind that you‚Äôre essentially asking the author to do free work to make you and your brand look better. This is a simplified version of the scenario, but you get the point. You may get lucky and the author will be generous and change the meta title and description because they‚Äôre kind-spirited, but in most cases, in order to get results, you‚Äôll need to clearly define the benefits these changes will bring to the author.
Emphasise the Benefits for Them
An improved, more relevant meta title and description will make the page more attractive to users on Google‚Äôs search results, thus increasing the probability of a user clicking on the result instead of a competitor‚Äôs. Clearer and more accurate content will improve the page‚Äôs Google rankings for relevant terms‚Äîboth improving current rankings and also expanding the ‚Äúkeyword pool‚Äù for the page (i.e. it will start ranking for additional search queries). Those are all big wins for the author.
There are many easy wins for ranking on Google for all sorts of search queries and keywords. Once you understand them, you can include them in your pitch. When explained well, the value of these changes is easy for the author to appreciate. Done intelligently, the benefit they derive from implementing your advice is reason in and of itself. The fact that you also benefit is secondary for them. That is the trick.
Examples of easy SEO wins for the author include improving meta titles, meta descriptions, headings, subheadings, and adding visuals. These are often minimal efforts for the author and will potentially bring them significant benefits. At the very least, making these adjustments will improve the content‚Äôs value for their users. Essentially, you are offering the author the most incredible low-risk, high-reward changes.
If they are open to the idea of changing the meta title and description, offer to provide these changes for them. This involves time and effort on your part but offers massive paybacks. Not only will they be more open to implementing your suggestions since you reduce the work on their end, but you can ensure the changes project a message on your Brand SERP that is 100% positive, accurate, and convincing. Even so, don‚Äôt be selfish in your changes; write the metas so they look great for your Brand SERP and also appeal to the author‚Äôs audience. Get the balance right, and both parties get a big win on Google.
If you provide value to the author and you can clearly demonstrate the value to them, you‚Äôll get the changes you want, you‚Äôll both benefit, and then, who knows? Perhaps your relationship will continue to develop and you‚Äôll do business further down the line.
  

     If the author is resistant to making changes, don‚Äôt keep pushing. Reel in your request and ask for just the core change you need. You can point out that changing the meta title and description doesn‚Äôt change the visible content on their page (the metas are only seen on Google‚Äôs search results). The integrity of their content remains untouched.
If they are still reticent, then there isn‚Äôt much of an appeal you can make. It‚Äôs the author‚Äôs content and their site, and they don‚Äôt owe you anything. If the author rejects your request, handle it with grace. You never know if you‚Äôll need to contact them again, or if they may change their mind later. Don‚Äôt burn any bridges you hope to stand on in the future. By making a tactful exit, you leave the door open to try again in a few months, perhaps with more specific details on how the changes will benefit them.
Making a direct appeal to the content‚Äôs author is often the best and most effective approach to improving results you have no control over.
Even if the author doesn‚Äôt modify their metas or their content, you haven‚Äôt lost anything except negligible time. And, you can still take action to reduce the impact on your Brand SERP if the result is negative. You can move the result down and off your Brand SERP using the Leapfrogging techniques from the Kalicube course, ‚ÄúDealing with Negative Content.‚Äù Nonetheless, making a direct appeal to the content‚Äôs author is often the best and most effective approach to improving results you have no control over.


Changes to third-party sites you don‚Äôt control may seem small and inconsequential, but they carry influence over your overall Brand SERP. Every detail on your Brand SERP counts, and every time you improve your Brand SERP, you look more convincing to your audience and more credible to Google, which is all that matters in the long run.
When paired with other SEO tactics, seemingly insignificant steps combine to produce first-page results. What many people perceive as details‚Äîa consistent brand message, positive sentiment around the brand, social media participation, Rich Elements, communication with third parties, etc.‚Äîare, in fact, fundamental to your business online. Each small detail adds up and gradually pushes you above your competition in the eyes of users and Google."
Explanation of SERP Features, that are also called Rich Elements, in the Context of Brand SERP Optimisation for Google and Bing	"When you search for your favorite comedian or look up a TV show, Google will likely show you a SERP with videos embedded in the results. The SERP is the ‚Äúanswer‚Äô‚Äô to your query and Google uses videos to create a better user experience. As the internet matures, so do the search results. Google is becoming an increasingly multimedia results engine. These multimedia results are known as Rich Elements or SERP Features: videos, audio, images, etc.
Any multimedia content you produce to support your online business, including social media posts, videos, images, and podcasts, has the potential to trigger Rich Elements. In fact, Brand SERPs often feature rich multimedia elements from third-party sites. Therefore, you‚Äôll need to monitor results you control, semi-control, and do not control, as they will all influence the Rich Elements Google chooses to include on your Brand SERP.

        Rich Elements are a real boon for your Brand SERP because they are much more visually appealing and they take up more space than other results, such as basic blue links. Since they take up more space (SERP real estate), incorporating Rich Elements will reduce the total number of results per page, which means there are less results you‚Äôll need to manage on the traffic-heavy and all- important first page. Rich Elements are also an opportunity to show your ‚Äúmost attractive face‚Äù to your clients and prospects when they Google your brand name, since Rich Elements make your Brand SERP look more professional and convincing. They can establish authority and credibility, while offering relevant information in different mediums.


 There are dozens of Rich Elements on Google search results, but only some will be candidates to appear on your Brand SERP. Twitter Boxes, Image Boxes, Video Boxes, Rich Sitelinks (as explored in Chapter 2), Top Stories, ‚ÄúPeople Also Ask‚Äù panels, and Related Searches are the primary contenders for Brand SERPs. As of May 2020, 15% of all Brand SERPs contained no Rich Elements, and by November 2021, the number had dropped to just 6% (‚ÄúKalicube Pro‚Äù). Rich Elements are becoming prevalent on Brand SERPs all around the world, and the total number has doubled in the past year:
It‚Äôs apparent: Rich Elements are a ‚Äúmust have‚Äù for any Brand SERP, and by actively managing and optimising Rich Elements, you can gain an advantage over your competitors.
Twitter Boxes
Twitter Boxes are arguably the best Rich Element to generate for your Brand SERP because they appear near the top and you directly control the content. Your original tweets feed directly into
     


     Google and are automatically presented as Rich Elements on your Brand SERP. Google fills your Twitter Boxes with the most recent live tweets from your profile. While this can certainly impress existing customers and prospects, triggering the boxes requires a solid Twitter strategy, so you will also be reaching a larger audience in the process. It‚Äôs a win-win approach to strengthening your online brand.
Relatively few brands have Twitter Boxes on their Brand SERPs, which is a serious ‚Äúmiss‚Äù on their part. They are both failing to utilize an impressive Rich Element and neglecting their Twitter strategy‚Äîa lose-lose situation!


 There‚Äôs no one-size-fits-all timeline for triggering Twitter Boxes on your Brand SERP; it depends on your tweeting habits, audience participation, and interaction with peers and influencers. Try to tweet 1-4 times a day, every day, with valuable content that gets engagement from relevant people and companies on Twitter. Your Twitter profile will gradually rank higher and higher on your Brand SERP over a month or two. When it appears as the second result, then you are getting close and a Twitter Box Rich Element should activate after another one to two months.
To guarantee success when tweeting, be sure to:
‚Ä¢ Create relevant content that supports your brand message
‚Ä¢ Use appropriate hashtags
‚Ä¢ Tag relevant people and companies
‚Ä¢ Use images and videos extensively
Image Boxes
If you agree with the adage that ‚Äúa picture is worth a thousand words,‚Äù then you‚Äôll want to have Image Boxes on your Brand SERP. Visuals not only draw the user‚Äôs attention, but they can communicate your brand message at a glance. As an added bonus, Image Boxes are usually the easiest Rich Element to get.
The strategy is simple‚Äîyou want to communicate your brand message using a great visual image. Every piece of content you publish should feature a quality image, whether it‚Äôs on your website, a social media platform, or a third-party site.
  

     Be strategic and consistent in your selection, though; you don‚Äôt want to end up with half a dozen disjointed photos that fail to convey a unified message on your Brand SERP. Instead, consider how each image fits into the wider bouquet of your brand message. Circulate a carefully-selected dozen or so images around the web (on your site, social media platforms, and third-party sites). Google will choose images for your Brand SERP that are frequently associated with your brand and appear on multiple relevant sources. The variety of sources indicates to Google the importance of these images to you and your audience, which increases the chances of triggering Image Boxes on your Brand SERP. The consistency of the images across those sources will vastly increase the probability that Google will show the images you chose. Without consistency, Google could display any photo associated with your brand and rob you of any control.


   Generating Successful Rich Elements
Twitter Boxes
‚Ä¢ Consistently create posts and content.
- Post relevant content, interact with reputable entities, and use multimedia elements to support your message.
‚Ä¢ Engage your audience and related businesses.
‚Ä¢ Showcase your brand name and message with your Twitter handle and profile description.
Image Boxes
‚Ä¢ Follow basic image SEO practices.1
‚Ä¢ Circulate about a dozen photos around your digital ecosystem.
‚Ä¢ Ensure that the images you select
1: Relate to your brand and its message.
2: Are original.
3: Don‚Äôt infringe on any copyright restrictions.
Video Boxes
‚Ä¢ Create videos that offer value to your audience and are related to your brand message.
‚Ä¢ Post them on appropriate platforms. Although YouTube dominates, other platforms such as Vimeo, Facebook, Twitter, etc. also contribute.
‚Ä¢ Encourage user engagement with your videos to trigger them on your Brand SERP.

      PAA Panels
‚Ä¢ Address the basic questions about your business on your website.
- This provides Google with authoritative answers to use in the PAA panels for user questions.
‚Ä¢ Answer questions around your core topics and prove you‚Äôre a respected authority by building relationships with reputable sites and businesses.
- Google will process these connections and will become more likely to include your answers for PAA panels.


 Video Boxes
Video Boxes also make great Rich Elements because they combine visuals with text on the Brand SERP, which offers an additional opening to communicate your brand message. Furthermore, video is an increasingly popular content format with users worldwide, and since Google knows this, it is keen to show relevant videos on Brand SERPs. Google actively seeks video content, so triggering Video Boxes is relatively straightforward: all you need to do is provide videos about your brand and industry that are genuinely relevant and helpful to your audience.
If you‚Äôre stuck using a smartphone or cheap camera, don‚Äôt worry‚ÄîGoogle doesn‚Äôt penalize videos for poor quality. Your audience might, but it‚Äôs up to you to make the video beneficial and worth their time. Videos that offer real value to your audience, present applicable insights, and answer relevant questions will compensate for poor technical quality. However, you should always make the highest-quality videos you can‚Äîsmartphones have amazing video and sound recording capabilities, so there really isn‚Äôt an excuse for poor quality videos.
For any new content to rank on your Brand SERP, it needs to provide more value to your audience than the results currently ranking.
  
     Videos take more time and resources to produce than written content, but they have multiple advantages.
1. Users love them.
2. Google prioritises them.
3. You can repurpose your videos into different formats across multiple platforms.
Ideally, since videos are a great format for your content strategy, you will build up a meaningful video production strategy and incorporate brand-relevant videos into it. For those videos you want to see in your Video Boxes, be sure to tie in your brand to the topic being discussed and include your brand name in the title. While it shouldn‚Äôt be a sales call, the video shouldn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúrandom.‚Äù Once again, it can take time for Google to understand that your videos are relevant enough to be included on your Brand SERP.
For any new content to rank on your Brand SERP, it needs to provide more value to your audience than the results currently ranking. This rule can apply to everything related to Brand SERP! As always, engagement, a uniform brand message, and consistent posting are key to getting your videos incorporated as a Rich Element on your Brand SERP.
 

  People Also Ask (PAA) Panels
Not only are PAA panels incredibly common, but their presence is increasing fast. In late 2020, 30% of Brand SERPs had them, and a year later, this figure had risen to over 50% (‚ÄúKalicube Pro‚Äù). PAA boxes suggest and answer commonly asked user questions. In the context of Brand SERPs, the questions are about the searched

 Creating a High-Value Video
‚Ä¢ Instructional how-tos: covers multiple audiences and can rank well for a wide range of questions outside Brand SERPs.
‚Ä¢ Interviews: associates your brand with an authority or celebrity.
‚Ä¢ Client stories: shares personal experiences of how your company has helped clients.
‚Ä¢ Webinar: discusses relevant topics with experts where the content brings value to the audience.
‚Ä¢ Reporting: describes your brand‚Äôs purpose or news surrounding your brand, ideally reported from others (DIY is okay, but make sure it reflects well on your brand image).
‚Ä¢ Conferences: displays a conference where you act as a sponsor, an exhibitor, or participant representing your brand.
‚Ä¢ Client support videos: demonstrates value to existing clients.
        
     brand, which vastly expands the opportunity for users to research a company directly on Google‚Äôs platform without clicking through to sites. And since your audience is increasingly staying on Google to research your brand, you need to provide those answers on Google‚Äôs SERP.
But who provides the answers to these questions? It‚Äôs a logical assumption to think the answers come from the brands themselves, but this is not the case. Less than 25% of the PAA questions on Brand SERPs are answered by the brand owners (‚ÄúKalicube Pro‚Äù). The rest are answered by random forums, news sites, B2B sites, or (worst-case scenario) competitors. Given how users frequently consult PAA panels and place trust in the answers, PAA panels are a top priority as a Brand SERP Rich Element.


 If you don‚Äôt answer the questions about your business, a third- party website will, and there‚Äôs no guarantee that those answers will be factual, complete, or unbiased. You can‚Äôt risk users seeing an imperfect representation of your brand message and services. So few PAA are answered by the brands themselves simply because the brands don‚Äôt provide clear answers for Google to use. In most cases, Google wants to provide answers ‚Äústraight from the horse‚Äôs mouth,‚Äù but it can‚Äôt! Google aims to produce clear, concise, and accurate answers, so you must ensure your website supplies them.
Here are two examples of prominent companies within a PAA panel. Ikea has answered the question on their own site, so Google is using their response. On the flip side, Jeep hasn‚Äôt provided a suitable answer to a user‚Äôs question, so Google is using another source, which is a missed shot for Jeep.


        To not miss these golden opportunities to answer potential client questions, develop the FAQ section on your website in an easily digestible way. Then, you increase the chance of Google selecting your answers. As you build your FAQ pages, compose brief 100-300 word answers to the questions your audience asks. Each question should be on a dedicated page‚Äîthis is easier for Google to deal with and also a better user experience for your audience, which is the ultimate goal for any business. Make sure not only to include but prioritize the questions on your Brand SERP.
General Advice on Rich Elements
As you start looking to trigger and optimise Rich Elements on your Brand SERP, remember that most of the elements will contain content from other platforms associated with your brand. So your strategy must include maintaining and optimising content about your
brand on multiple platforms. If you consistently create engaging and audience-centric content about your brand, more Rich Elements will naturally appear on your Brand SERP. Google wants to show amazing, relevant content on your Brand SERP, and it tends to prioritise multimedia results. In addition, your online audience also wants rich, immersive content centered around your brand. Simply put, the more you create relevant, multimedia content, the better off you‚Äôll be from every perspective.
Rich Elements are the single most valuable strategy for developing a distinctive and impressive Brand SERP.
Multimedia content offers unique benefits because it‚Äôs quick and easy to consume, it provides digestible information, and it grabs the audience‚Äôs attention. For more information on creating and presenting content that appeals to Google‚Äôs algorithm, please refer to the chapter on SEO tactics (Chapter Eight) and the relevant Kalicube course (‚ÄúTriggering and Optimising Rich Elements‚Äù).
Rich Elements are the single most valuable strategy for developing a distinctive and impressive Brand SERP. They even come with a simple yet powerful bonus; by focusing your online strategy on this easy ‚Äúwin,‚Äù you‚Äôre also improving your digital ecosystem and audience outreach at the same time.
To know if your efforts are on the right track, look at your Brand SERP. The more multimedia content Google shows, the more well-developed and powerful your online content strategy is. Once you‚Äôve generated enough ‚Äúnoise‚Äù online, your brand may be given a Knowledge Panel, which is arguably the final seal of Google‚Äôs approval of your brand."
Explanation of Knowledge Panels in the Context of Brand SERP Optimisation for Google and Bing	"Google‚Äôs Knowledge Panels are the ultimate Rich Element‚Äîthey add credibility to your brand, demonstrate Google‚Äôs stamp of approval, and offer users a convenient package of information on your brand.

     Essentially, Knowledge Panels are representa- tions of Google‚Äôs understanding of the world, including its understanding of your brand.
A Knowledge Panel will often appear on the right-hand side of search results on desktop when you search for an entity: people, places, organisations, podcasts, music groups, films, TV series, etc. In short, any searchable ‚Äúthing.‚Äù This panel contains information Google considers to be factual in response to a user‚Äôs search query. Essentially, Knowledge Panels are representations of Google‚Äôs understanding of the world, including its understanding of your brand.
It is fundamentally important that Google has its facts straight so it can build your Brand SERP to accurately depict who you are, what you do, and what audience you serve. An optimised Knowledge Panel of your brand will prompt a more beneficial Brand SERP. Therefore, having an accurate and helpful Knowledge Panel is an absolute must-have for your brand.
Google‚Äôs Knowledge Panel gathers fragments of information from a wide range of trusted and authoritative online sources. This is done using an algorithm to review and evaluate human-curated information (Wikipedia, Google Books, etc.) and other content found by GoogleBot. The information is cross-referenced using trusted sources to try to ensure its accuracy. Google‚Äôs ultimate goal is to compile truthful and accurate information and present it in a useful way for its users.
You have partial control over what your audience sees in the Knowledge Panel when they Google your brand name. The process is simple: as you optimise your Brand SERP, you will correct the


 most influential information about your brand. This will naturally create a better understanding for Google and build confidence in its understanding. Eventually, Google will trigger a Knowledge Panel that accurately reflects your brand (or ensure an existing Knowledge Panel portrays accurate information over time).
An accurate and well-documented Knowledge Panel is a strong indication that Google understands who you are, what you do, and who your audience is. That makes for a more representative Brand SERP, better SEO performances, and (the cherry on the cake) it increases credibility to prospective clients. Knowledge Panels are becoming a common fixture for branded queries, so not having one can hurt your business since it may discourage prospects and returning customers.
Credibility will help build and stabilise your Knowledge Panel. Google calls this EAT: Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness. Demonstrating to Google that your brand is respected and in demand by your peers and your audience is essential to securing a Knowledge Panel. So, you need to generate a buzz in your peer community and with your audience. You can reinforce this curated buzz by including links from your site to the third-party content that mentions your brand. Then, Google is sure to understand that all of the media attention is, indeed, about you, and thereby improve your E-A-T credentials. This positive buzz around your brand will not only help Google recognise your relevancy, but it will also improve its understanding and confidence in that understanding‚Äînot to mention the publicity will increase brand awareness in your target audience and potentially increase sales. There‚Äôs another big bonus to remember: a better E-A-T score will be a significant help to your overall SEO strategy.
  

       EAT at Google
This acronym is related to how Google measures credibility.
Expertise: Is the information accurate? Is the writer or brand a credible source for writing about the topic?
Authoritativeness: Is the author well-respected in their field? Is the brand widely recognized in the industry? Is the content referred to elsewhere on the web by other reputable and authoritative websites, brands, and people?
Trustworthiness: Does the brand and writer have a good reputation, and does the audience trust them?
Google judges credibility, or ‚ÄúEAT,‚Äù at three levels: the content, the author, and the publisher. As you develop your Brand SERP, make sure you pass the ‚ÄúEAT‚Äù test and that any businesses or sites you cultivate a relationship with also meet these standards.
 The three determining factors for your Knowledge Panel are:
1. Google‚Äôs understanding of who you are
2. Google‚Äôs confidence in its understanding
3. The probability that the user‚Äôs search query refers to a specific entity and that the Knowledge Panel is therefore helpful to the user


 Building a diverse and active digital ecosystem is essential for building accurate brand understanding, confidence, and awareness. This ‚Äúwinning‚Äù combination is what will ultimately generate a Knowledge Panel for your brand.
Knowledge Panel Composition
Knowledge Panels display brief summaries about searched- for entities. Take the Knowledge Panel of Leonardo Da Vinci as an example.


     Google uses a vast number of sources to verify Da Vinci‚Äôs artistic contributions and it recognises other information as facts, such as his birth date. Google is able to associate Da Vinci with some of his artworks, and also identifies him as a 15th century Italian painter connected to Michelangelo by these attributes. In the Knowledge Panel, Google links those entities and facts together to create connections, much like the human brain does. As a result, Google can display a summary of the most useful information concerning Leonardo Da Vinci, while allowing users to find other related information about him with a single click. Now imagine what a Knowledge Panel would look like for your brand and how it might make a difference to your audience.
A Brand SERP that features a rich and accurate Knowledge Panel allows users to understand your brand, mission, and product/service with one search‚Äîa huge win for your digital strategy.
Knowledge Panels are a growing SERP element in Google‚Äôs world. There is a lot to understand about them, but the core idea is relatively straightforward: Knowledge Panels provide a quick summary of your brand in one panel. Thus, they aid Google‚Äôs goal of displaying an unbiased overview of your brand, while also answering basic user questions and eliminating the need to visit multiple sites for information about you. As with every strategy discussed in this book, SEO techniques will amplify the benefits of Knowledge Panels.

Explanation of the Basics of Search Engine Optimisation in the Context of Brand SERP Optimisation for Google and Bing	"Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) tactics are the key tools on your Brand SERP belt and the foundation of the wider digital strategy for your brand. Because they are ‚Äúgood housekeeping‚Äù for online content and reputation, consistently applying SEO techniques and strategies will vastly improve your brand‚Äôs digital presence, starting (of course) with your Brand SERP. Any improvements you make to your Brand SERP will improve your overall digital presence, online reputation, content marketing efforts, SEO, and by extension, your sales too. It seems too good to be true, but the cumulation of many small improvements offers big wins for you across the board long term. Luckily, the majority of the SEO tactics you‚Äôll need are non- technical, simple, and easy to implement.
The importance of SEO to any brand strategy cannot be emphasised enough, as evident in the numerous online articles covering SEO techniques, tactics, and strategies. But not all of these articles effectively break down the SEO approach, few make SEO accessible to non-technical people and even fewer consider the benefits beyond ranking on Google and Bing.
  

     If you approach SEO from a Brand SERP perspective, you can be just as effective and get a better ROI with very little need for a technical department.1 In short, you can flip focus and resources from 20% content and 80% technical to 20% technical and 80% content. By understanding SEO from a Brand SERP perspective, you can vastly reduce your reliance on the technical aspects and prioritise engaging your audience with the content you create. Of course, you still need the technical foundation (which I describe briefly later in this chapter), but you can focus more resources on creating great content for your audience so your business can drive sales. Prioritising the customer with this approach is just common sense in business. Whatever your objective, whether it‚Äôs internet fame or acquiring a steady stream of clients, practical, non-technical SEO tactics should absolutely be a part of your daily plug and chug.
Revisit the Basic Motive
My approach to SEO is straightforward‚Äîit‚Äôs packaging your content to help Google perform and achieve its goals. Google‚Äôs users are (explicitly or implicitly) searching for an answer to a question or problem, so Google‚Äôs ultimate aim is to provide its users with the most effective and efficient answer or solution. And just like any business, Google prioritises customer satisfaction and will recommend you as the solution only when it is convinced you can satisfy its user.
1 ROI: Return on Investment
 


 Google‚Äôs understanding and perception of your brand is central to your Brand SERP and also to your overall SEO strategy. For every Google search where your brand appears, it synthesises your content and frames the information within its understanding of your brand.
If you begin viewing each and every Google SERP as a product and package your content so it can contribute to that product, then your overall SEO strategy will shift. You will have a more realistic, less technical, marketing-focused approach to SEO that will ultimately be more successful.
So Google‚Äôs understanding of your brand‚Äîwho you are, what you do, and which audience you serve‚Äîis key. And your Brand SERP is an easy-to-read reflection of Google‚Äôs understanding of your brand, your content, and your relationship with your audience. You truly are ‚Äúwinning the game‚Äù when your Brand SERP is an accurate reflection of you, projects the brand message you want, and contains content that is engaging your audience to the point where they become brand advocates."
Explanation of the Three Pillars of Search Engine Optimisation in the Context of Brand SERP Optimisation for Google and Bing	"The three basic pillars of SEO.


     There are three crucial pillars for effective SEO: 1. Understanding
- How well does Google understand who you are, what you offer, and who your audience is?
¬É OnceGoogleunderstandsyouandwhichaudience you serve, the algorithms can start offering your content as a solution to the subsection of its users who are your audience.
2. Credibility
- Is Google confident that your business is superior to your competition?
¬É After you‚Äôve established credibility (EAT), you will beat your competition as the best candidate as a solution to the user‚Äôs search query.
3. Suitability
- Is your content a good fit for the Google SERP ‚Äúproduct‚Äù?
¬É Google‚Äôs ultimate aim (its product) is to help its users effectively find the best solutions to the problems they express with a search query. Essentially, your goal becomes helping Google achieve its goal, which is helping its users achieve their goals.
If you begin viewing each and every Google SERP as a product and package your content so it can contribute to that product, then your overall SEO strategy will shift. You will have a more realistic, less technical, marketing-focused approach to SEO that will ultimately be more successful.



 You need to understand and apply this approach and use SEO techniques in order to optimise your Brand SERP and that, in turn, will help your overall SEO strategy. I advise all of my clients to build their online strategy from the Brand SERP outwards. Implementing effective SEO on your Brand SERP will improve the wider online impact of your brand.
The days when you could succeed in SEO with just one tactic are long gone. In the past, low-quality content could rank by having boatloads of backlinks, and well-optimised content could rank with just a few backlinks. It was a tactics-based contest. Not anymore. You need to have a strategic brand approach for SEO to deliver ROI. And your Brand SERP is the window into the effectiveness of this strategy.
The vast majority of companies and brands working on their SEO haven‚Äôt laid the proper foundations. Ask yourself: ‚ÄúWhat is the core of my business? Am I performing there?‚Äù Your Brand SERP provides a simple and powerful insight into this question. If it reflects who you are and how your audience perceives you, then you are on the right track and you just need to leverage the insights your Brand SERP provides to improve your winning strategy. If not, you need to use your Brand SERP to recalibrate and improve your digital strategy, then build outwards.
The Game-Changing Hummingbird
Prior to 2013, SEO was just a numbers game. For years, Google used to evaluate the number and ratio of words, factor in the number and quality of inbound links, and then calculate a ranking based on a word-and-link count. The rudimentary system made it easy for smart marketers and business owners to find tricks and tactics to manipulate Google.

     That is no longer the case. In 2013, Google released the ‚ÄúHummingbird‚Äù update. With Hummingbird, Google started to understand the world in a manner similar to the human brain; it analyses things (entities) such as companies and understands them through their relationship to other entities, such as products and offers. So now, instead of counting links and words, Google analyses the pieces‚Äîit evaluates its understanding of your business and your offers, much like a human being would. Google ‚Äúintelligently‚Äù evaluates the solution you can provide and calculates the match between your solution and the needs of the person, and the quality of your solution compared to your competition.
With this new approach, quality offers with genuine value to Google‚Äôs users are increasingly dominating the results. In order to be part of this revolution, you need to help Google better understand your brand, your content, and your offers by employing SEO techniques on your content.
The Foundational Techniques
The first, and most important, technique is clear copywriting. Google understands entities and relationships between them, much like we humans do. The foundation of this is using Subject-Verb- Object‚Äîgrammar everyone learns in school. Google calls this a semantic triple, which may sound complicated, but it is actually just standard sentence composition. Google‚Äôs algorithm is looking for the ‚Äúsubject verb object‚Äù within your content. Basically, the verb should demonstrate the relationship between the subject (the primary entity) and the object (the other entity), and the three parts should be close together so the machine doesn‚Äôt get confused. This means writing ‚ÄúAdidas makes shoes‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúAdidas, the German company founded in 1949, makes shoes.‚Äù


 Naturally, there‚Äôs a balance between writing compelling copy that appeals to customers and using transparent language to inform Google. Your writing should be clear and use precise verbs to describe the relationships between identifiable entities. Google is trying to understand who you are and what you have to offer its user; a semantic triple simplifies its processing of this information. With clear copywriting, Google will be able to connect the entities correctly in its ‚Äúmind‚Äù and understand the meaning of the text, and you should still be able to keep the content attractive to your site visitors.
The trick is to write clear content for Google to easily process without weighing down the language so much that your audience no longer enjoys it. As such, ensure you ‚Äúsandwich‚Äù semantic triples between more attractive and compelling sentences. Semantic triples may improve Google‚Äôs understanding of your content, but your audience will not appreciate paragraphs solely composed of short, abrupt sentences.
Another powerful writing technique is mastering the use of headings. Used properly, they are helpful to users and instructive to Google about the written content on your page. Be sure to include only one H1 (primary title), which functions as a short description of the overall topic of the page. Then you‚Äôll have one or more secondary headings (H2) used to divide the content into subtopics. Each should briefly and clearly describe what information the user (and Google) will find in the subsequent paragraphs. Think of it like a book: the H1 is the front-cover title of the book and each H2 is a chapter title. The user (and Google) should be able to skim through the headings and immediately understand what the page is all about and which section they should refer to for any specific questions.
  


     Multimedia plays into this more than you perhaps realise. Google has invested vast resources analysing images and videos to help it understand the world. Semantic triples in your written content are great. Providing supporting rich media is critical.
Plain written content is not enough anymore; the results need to be supported with multimedia for Google and your audience to find your content relevant and valuable. Mixed media, such as images, videos, and audio, are an effective way to communicate with the audience and they bring immense added value to your Brand SERP too. This ties back to the idea of replacing results on your Brand SERP page with rich results. Multimedia results are not only more impressive and convincing for your audience, but they push other, less relevant links down on the page. And because they are large, they often reduce the total number of results shown on the first page.
When adding multimedia elements such as images to your content, make sure to enter descriptive alt tags (the HTML explanatory code for a graphic) and use a clear file name. The site visitor won‚Äôt see either, but these tags will help Google understand the contents of your multimedia elements and encourage it to add Rich Elements to your Brand SERP. Improving your Brand SERP is about optimising every piece of content about and around your brand using every possible technique available to you, no matter how basic.
On the technical side of SEO for your Brand SERP, all of the content needs to be ‚Äúcrawlable.‚Äù Basically, Google needs permission to visit and digest your content without being blocked by security rules. Crawlability also refers to ensuring that there is a discernible path to each page from the homepage. Header menus, footers, links in your web pages, including your homepage, significantly improve Google‚Äôs maneuverability, which will ultimately improve your SEO.

 Your website pages need to be fast-loading, mobile-friendly, and organised in blocks to be easy to digest for Google. Pages should ideally load in under two seconds for your average 3G connection. Google is all about user satisfaction, and site users are going to be frustrated if they have to wait too long for content. Google measures the speed of every page and then uses the data to influence your ranking. Although page speed is important in SEO, it is less important for Brand SERPs and should not come at the expense of crawlability, mobile friendliness, organising content in blocks, and the quality of the content itself.
A mobile-friendly website means that the design, images, videos, etc. display correctly and are ergonomic on the smaller screen of a mobile device (phone or tablet). Think about some of the sites you frequently visit; if you are using a mobile device, you‚Äôll either have an ergonomic display right off the bat or be prompted to move to the company‚Äôs dedicated mobile app or mobile site. These are all ways companies can provide a great experience for their users on mobile. Google is actively checking to see if a site‚Äôs mobile version satisfies customers. When the site falls short, it is at a distinct disadvantage: Google doesn‚Äôt want to send its users to a site with second-rate experience on mobile.
Another important SEO factor is the visual appeal of the content. Is it attractive? Readable? Did you include multimedia elements? It might sound strange, but Google has technology that allows the machine to visualise your page, meaning its algorithms judge these aspects too. These components improve your SEO ‚Äúscore‚Äù and can be simple ways to improve the performance of your content on Google for both your Brand SERP and your wider SEO strategy.

     When organising the content, you want the information to be broken into digestible blocks or ‚Äúchunks.‚Äù When your content has clear, identifiable blocks, such as paragraphs or sections, then Google can more easily analyse the page, understand the content, and (importantly) determine the key points. Google takes these key points and repurposes them in the SERP in many ways: Knowledge Panel descriptions, Featured Snippets, People Also Ask panel, thumbnail images, sitelinks, and many more. Great ‚Äúcontent chunking‚Äù helps Google help its users, which means you win too.
Here‚Äôs some content Google has extracted from the middle of a well-chunked page and used on a SERP:

   Writing for Online Content
The writing style for online content is very different from a letter or this book. As you write the content for your brand, be clear and concise, explain who you are, your products/services, and why a user should select your business.
Keep the writing intelligible; you don‚Äôt need to ‚Äúdumb it down‚Äù for users, but you also aren‚Äôt trying to win any creative writing contests here. The end goal is to get your brand message across to your audience and Google effectively. Accessible writing also makes the content more visually appealing, especially when combined with well-organised chunks. Nobody wants to visit a site and be met with a giant block of text they‚Äôll have to to find the key information.
Direct language also ensures that sentences still make sense when taken out of the context of your web page. When Google grabs a chunk of your content to answer a user‚Äôs query, the content needs to make sense in the context of Google‚Äôs SERP. It needs to stand alone and convey information without the user navigating to visit your site. Does your content pass this test?


     
You need Google to understand your content, but you want to maintain balance so your writing still appeals to the reader, who is, after all, the most important consumer. Users can tell superficial writing from genuine content, so be sincere. Try to include their point of view and speak to the person beyond the screen. Many brands write from their own perspective with an inside view, and they forget that the people consuming the content are perhaps meeting the business for the first time. Don‚Äôt assume the reader knows you or your services, and start with a compelling introduction to your brand. As you write, focus on their viewpoint and try to create a team spirit, the idea that together, you and I, can solve the problem you‚Äôre facing.
Always remember the fundamental rules for establishing an online presence: Be relevant. Provide valuable content. Stay on topic."
Explanation of the Basics of Search Engine Optimisation Techniques that Ampilfy your Brand in the Context of Brand SERP Optimisation for Google and Bing	"Tactics that Amplify Your Digital Signal
There‚Äôs a myriad of other tactics for improving your SEO and Brand SERP to amplify and improve your digital signal. Other tactics include internal, external, and inbound linking, fresh content, third-party corroboration, and user-generated content.
Internal linking serves as a navigation tool. Anticipate what the user will need on your site and create logical links within your pages. Think of this as creating signposts to valuable content for users in need of directions. Be sure to add links to your content only when they are relevant to the user since the primary goal is to help them.

 Then, think about linking to and from results on other sites that are within your control (social media, profile pages, guest articles, reviews, etc.). These are valuable resources for your audience and they are also helpful to Google since it sees the connections between these third party sites and yours, thus solidifying its understanding of you.
In your content, you‚Äôll also want to include some relevant links to other credible sites. (But don‚Äôt overdo it; one or two external links per page is usually enough).
You can achieve this in two different ways:
1. Include links to a third-party site that mentions your brand. A mention or interview on a powerful site, such as entre- preneur.com, is great, but don‚Äôt overlook industry-specific sites. These third-party industry-specific mentions will be just as powerful for your brand because of the authority they have in your niche and the value they offer to your audience. For instance, if I‚Äôm running a dog shampooing salon in Paris, it‚Äôs just as valuable, arguably more valu- able, to be mentioned by poodleparloursinparis.com. This embedded link on your website will benefit your authority in Google‚Äôs ‚Äúmind,‚Äù which will help your EAT, your SEO, and your Brand SERP. Relationships with relevant sites es- tablish you as an authority in your industry and indicate to Google that your content is relevant and important to your audience.
2. Embed links to credible sources within your content, even when your brand isn‚Äôt mentioned. In a discussion on SEO, you could quote and link to an article from inc.com: ‚ÄúSEO


     is a future department of marketing that can be a make- or-break strategy for a company. SEO will increase your digital presence and acquire a larger customer base for your business.‚Äù Doing this gives Google a reference to check the accuracy of what you are saying, and since inc. com is an authoritative magazine for small businesses and entrepreneurs, the link to their article will help build trust, which will improve your SEO and your overall Brand SERP.
The more you can establish respected connections and build a reputation in the industry, the better your Brand SERP will be and the more your SEO strategy will perform. These online connections are the way you can build your E-A-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness). Google sees and understands links and mentions. The more implicit and explicit connections you have to other relevant, credible sources, the more your E-A-T will benefit. From there, there‚Äôs a snowball effect of improvement, so your Brand SERP will look better and your investments in SEO will provide greater ROI.
Starting from Scratch and Growing Outwards
If you have a small online reach and few connections, the natural way to increase both is to generate fresh, relevant content that is meaningful to your peers, attractive to your industry, and engaging for your audience.
As we have seen, creating fresh content, packaging it for Google, and encouraging user participation will not only improve your Brand SERP, but will also boost your wider SEO and overall digital performance. Create a plan to add new content regularly.


 It doesn‚Äôt have to be every day, or even every week, but there needs to be a consistent flow of ‚Äúaction‚Äù on your site and your preferred social channels. Consistent content production strengthens Google‚Äôs trust in your brand while also increasing audience loyalty and engagement. It‚Äôs a win-win.
Some content you create will be everlasting, as the basic information about your company won‚Äôt change very much over the years. An article or video about the fundamentals of your industry won‚Äôt significantly change either. Even so, updating it from time to time (perhaps once a year) clearly indicates to Google that the information is still accurate and relevant. Other content is short term and will be relevant and helpful for a few days, weeks, or months. Both types of content are needed for your audience and Google.
Once you have a consistent content routine, it is a great idea to post links to your new content on your social media accounts. The links will help Google find the content and see that it is relevant and valuable to your audience. Google will then improve its understanding, build its confidence in you as a brand, and improve your Brand SERP. It will also encourage your social media followers to visit, or revisit, your site, which is a non-negligible ‚Äúbonus.‚Äù It‚Äôs another win-win.
It is incredibly important to link your social media profiles to your site and link your site to your social media profiles. Two-way linking is vital for Google to be confident that these are indeed your social media profiles. Once Google is confident, it will push your relevant social media content higher up your Brand SERP, and as we saw in a previous chapter, this activity will help push those social profiles up your Brand SERP and trigger those Rich Elements.


     Whether on social media, on third-party sites, or on your own site, your content should be attractive and valuable to your audience. This applies to written content and multimedia elements embedded in your content, as well as any other ways your brand communicates with your audience online.
You also need to look at what your audience is saying. What your audience says about you online is even more important than what you say about yourself. Encourage clients and peers to speak positively about you on social media, forums, and their own sites. Reviews in particular are powerful, especially on independent third- party sites. If you feel that encouraging reviews from your customers or feedback from your peers is a gamble, then think about why this might be. If you aren‚Äôt confident enough in your products and services to expect positive feedback, then start by improving them to the point where you are confident that over 80% of feedback will be positive. Only then should you start actively encouraging audience feedback on social media, in articles, and through reviews.
Because the feedback from your clients, partners, and peers is impartial, it is a very strong quality signal to Google and a major contributor to your E-A-T, not to mention an incredibly powerful encouragement for your prospective clients. And, of course, content that contains impartial feedback from your audience will also be a good candidate for your Brand SERP.
This chapter is a little lengthy because SEO techniques are the driving force behind your ability to design the anatomy of your ‚ÄúGoogle Business Card.‚Äù It‚Äôs no exaggeration to say that SEO techniques are the means by which you communicate with Google and educate it about your brand.



But bear in mind they are just one part of your overall Brand SERP strategy. Google heavily depends on the content and quality signals across your entire digital ecosystem: your site, social media platforms, third-party mentions, content you create, content you distribute, audience engagement, feedback, reviews, etc. In short, this means everything available online. Google analyses and processes everything you do online and everything surrounding your brand. This means all of your brand‚Äôs actions and audience feedback affect Google‚Äôs understanding of your brand and its credibility. SEO techniques are a way to package all of this for Google so that it understands the content and appreciates its true value, which in turn allows Google to better understand your brand and evaluate your credibility.
Even if you‚Äôve worked through each technique and strategy in this book thus far, some brands require more help in order to generate organic traffic and capture audience attention. Google Ads offer an easy, cost-effective way to optimise your Brand SERP real estate and potentially gain sales."
Explanation of the Google Ads in the Context of Brand SERP Optimisation for Google and Bing	"Advertisements can be a tricky grey area in brand-building. Too few, and you‚Äôll struggle to build your client base; too many, and your brand loses the perceived esteem. In your digital marketing strategy, you have to be very strategic in choosing where to run your ads since there are an endless number of options.
Google is generally a good starting point. Remember, the people Googling your brand name are your audience. If they are using Google, then they see Google as trustworthy and authoritative. The message it projects through your Brand SERP is important to you. Google Ads appear front and center at the top of your Brand SERP, and more importantly, you control the message.

     Before incorporating Google Ads into your Brand SERP strategy, it‚Äôs important to have some context on how Google Ads works.
Consider how many times a day people visit Google to verify a quick fact, navigate to a website, conduct intensive research, or go shopping. Google processes several billion searches every day. The running count on this screenshot never paused for a single second; people were continuously searching on Google.1
Google generates income by inserting ads at the top of some search results. Between 4% and 10% of searches on Google contain ads; this depends on the country, language, and device (‚ÄúSemrush‚Äù). Ads on Google searches look very similar to organic search results, as you can see here:


    Google only charges the advertiser if the user clicks on the ad, which makes it an attractive form of online advertising. This is called ‚ÄúPay Per Click.‚Äù
You have probably realised that, as an advertiser, this is an opportunity to jump the queue, get your offers to the top of Google‚Äôs search results, and generate organic traffic simply by paying Google. But using this strategy to get your ad to the top of Google is not as easy or straightforward as you might think. For popular search queries, a lot of companies are vying to get the top position on the search results through Google Ads. Google uses a complex algorithm to decide which ones to show and how much to charge for each click. The algorithm judges the quality of the advertisements,


     their relevance to the search query, and the quality of the site behind the ad. It selects the ones most likely to get a click from the user and therefore generate revenue for Google.
How Can You ‚ÄúScore‚Äù an Ad?
Google Ads is a bidding system. Advertisers bid against each other to appear on the search queries they are interested in. You might think the advertiser who pays the most will always win, but this is not necessarily true. The algorithm uses Google Ads Quality Score to evaluate which ads appear at the top of the SERP and also how much the advertiser will pay for a click. The algorithm aims to drive revenue for Google, but not at the expense of ruining the search results page for the user. This is where Quality Score comes into play. The algorithm uses Quality Score to ensure it only retains ads that are relevant and helpful to its users.
But Google goes further than this. It rewards advertisers who produce ads that truly satisfy its users by applying lower cost per click to ads with a higher Quality Score. The higher the Quality Score, the less Google will charge for the click on the ad. It sounds strange, but the system maintains a balance where all three parties are happy: advertisers, Google‚Äôs users, and (of course) Google.
The Google Ads algorithm calculates Quality Score on a scale of 1 to 10. With a score of 10 for an ad, the advertiser will pay significantly less for a click on their ad than an advertiser who produces an ad with a Quality Score of 5. Obviously the ratios change depending on markets, competition, and algorithm updates, but to give you an idea, an advertiser with a Quality Score of 10 might pay 10x less than an advertiser who produces an ad with a Quality Score of 1.


 Quality Score is measured according to three factors:
1. Ad relevance for the user
2. Expected click-through rate (CTR)
3. Landing page experience
The details of how the algorithm behind Google Ads actually functions is a mystery, much like the search (SEO) algorithm. We know the levers to pull to get profitable results, but Google keeps the behind-curtain workings obscure. It‚Äôs like completing a puzzle in the dark‚Äîyou can recognize some of the pieces and put them together, but you can‚Äôt see what the pieces look like. You have to multitask here: work from the outside to make the Google Ads perform for your business, while also satisfying Google and its users. Quality Score is the measurement we can see, understand, and actively manage, so improving its three factors will optimise your Google Ads campaigns.
Ad Relevance
If a user searches for ‚Äúbuy red shoes‚Äù and an advertiser is bidding on this search result with an ad offering blue hats, Google will score the ad very low for relevance since the result does not provide a relevant solution to the search query. Google will charge an advertiser more if they place an ad for hats on a search for shoes.


     Expected Click-Through Rate
This factor is calculated according to how well the ad is written. An ad will be attributed a high Quality Score if it presents an attractive offer to the user, has great copywriting, and uses tone and vocabulary to entice a user to click on the ad. Subsequently, an advertiser will pay less if their ad contains great copywriting and their offer is attractive and well-presented.
Landing Page Experience
When analysing the landing page experience for users, the algorithm looks at what happens after the user has clicked on the ad. Google asks itself several questions: does the page actually offer what is promised in the ad? Is the web page user-friendly? An advertiser will pay less if Google sees that their page loads quickly, has an appropriate offer, is well-presented, and solves its user‚Äôs problem efficiently.
Once you understand the three factors that influence high Quality Scores and drive low cost per click, solving the Google Ads ‚Äúpuzzle‚Äù is certainly doable.
Brand SERPs and Google Ads
When it comes to Brand SERPs and Google Ads, a couple of questions immediately spring to mind. Why would I place an ad on my own brand name? If I do, how can I ensure I get a high Quality Score and keep costs down?

 Not every brand needs to bid on their own brand name. Sometimes competitors will bid on your brand name and their ads will appear at the top of your Brand SERP. When this happens, you will definitely want to act and create a Google Ads campaign of your own to get them off your Brand SERP.
If your competitors never appear in the paid results on your Brand SERP, then your own website will appear at the top, and you have no obvious need to consider Google Ads for your brand name. However, before rejecting Google Ads out of hand, consider that a well-optimised branded ad campaign costs little (starting at a few cents per click) and allows you to dominate the top positions of your Brand SERP with a message you control.
For a search involving your exact brand term, you will generally score high for all three Quality Score factors with absolutely no effort. Even so, there are many techniques to improve each factor further and boost your Quality Score to significantly reduce cost. By improving each of the components, my clients often reduce their cost per click by 30% or more.
My clients also gain more control of their Brand SERP. When you have an ad at the top, especially a rich ad like Hubspot‚Äôs below, you control significantly more real estate on your Brand SERP, which is ideal for Brand SERP optimisation. As you can see, HubSpot controls the SERP real estate for everything the user sees when the page initially loads (above the fold):
  


        This direct control is a crucial part in HubSpot‚Äôs marketing strategy, and with their combination of an ad and Rich Sitelinks, HubSpot is significantly reducing any possible ‚Äúleak to the competition‚Äù of their clients and prospects.
So, with or without your competitors placing ads on your Brand SERP, Google Ads may be a profitable strategy. Here‚Äôs how you keep costs down.


 Ad Relevance: By definition, you are the most relevant for your own brand name, so you might think there are no improvements to be made here. This is one mistake most brands make. They don‚Äôt isolate their own brand name in a dedicated Google Ads campaign. When you have an ad campaign centered around your exact brand name, Google‚Äôs algorithms better understand the relevance of the ads within the campaign and this pushes your ad relevance score upwards.
Expected Click-Through Rate: The CTR of your ad to an audience who is searching for your brand might seem inconsequential. This assumption couldn‚Äôt be more wrong. Great copywriting that appeals to your audience is never a ‚Äúgiven.‚Äù A bad ad is a bad ad, even on a Brand SERP, so put in the work on your presentation.
Landing Page Experience: Once again, this may seem like a given. You certainly have an advantage over the competition since the offer you present is exactly what they are looking for. And yet, there are several levers you can use here to help you win big with your Google Ads campaign. Most brands use their homepage as the landing page, but a dedicated landing page elevates your brand to the next level.
1. You have more leeway to optimise it for the Google Ads algorithm.
2. You can make the page load faster and improve the brand message on the page.
3. You can even present attractive, dedicated special offers on the page that your audience will be unable to resist.


     When implemented intelligently, all of these ‚Äúbonus‚Äù benefits will increase user engagement, which is the signal the algorithm is looking at for this aspect of the Quality Score.
Advice for Specific Situations
International Campaigns: If you target several territories, then consider creating a Google Ads campaign for each. Relevancy is unlikely to be a significant lever here, but expected CTR and landing page experience certainly are. Adjustments to language, culture, and regional vocabulary are all going to help improve your expected CTR and landing page experience for each territory.
Protecting Yourself Against Ad ‚ÄúTheft‚Äù: Your competitors are allowed to bid on your brand name and try to entice your audience with a paid result through Google Ads.
Unfortunately, by default, Google will allow competitors to use your brand name in their ad copy on your Brand SERP until the day you explicitly inform Google of your trademark claim. Make your claim on every trademarked territory with your brand name to ensure your competitors will no longer be able to use your brand name in their copywriting. If you combine this with the other strategies I mention, they will disappear from the top of your Brand SERP and stop leeching off of your good reputation.
In conclusion, Google Ads rewards advertisements with high Quality Scores by charging the advertiser less per ad click. On your own brand name, you have a significant natural advantage over your competitors, which means you have the power to push your Quality Score way up. And because Google Ads Quality Score
 

is relative, your ad successes happen at your competitor‚Äôs literal expense. The ad cost works like a seesaw: the better Quality Score you have, the less you pay, and the more expensive it is for your competitor.
The Kalicube course, ‚ÄúThe Fundamentals of Brand SERPs,‚Äù offers a module on Google Ads that contains more techniques to reduce ad costs for your brand campaign.
Google‚Äôs bottom line is user satisfaction, so it will only reduce their satisfaction for the ‚Äúright‚Äù cost. Your competitor will have to pay this higher cost if they bid on your Brand SERP real estate. Your competitor‚Äôs business is relevant to your results because your products/services are related, so Google is willing to include their ad. But you still have control here. The better you optimise your Google ad, the less likely it will be for your competitor to gain traction and appear on your Brand SERP, potentially stealing your prospects and customers from right under your nose.
Some businesses look for quick and easy shortcut solutions to generate Google Ads traffic using automated platforms. These can work well for non-brand searches, but very rarely work in the specific context of Brand SERPs. As a general rule, Google does not take kindly to cheaters, not with Google Ads or any other Brand SERP feature. You create a strong, secure digital ecosystem by investing real time and effort. Any attempt to outsmart Google endangers both your brand and reputation and allows your competition to get ahead."
Explanation of Tactics to Avoid in the Context of Brand SERP Optimisation for Google and Bing	"The leading message of this book is that Google is your new business card, and your Brand SERP reflects the world‚Äôs opinion of your brand. The most valuable aspect of a Brand SERP is its ability to emphasise your quality and credibility as a business. As long as your Brand SERP achieves this goal and benefits your brand, you have unparalleled wins with a great ‚ÄúGoogle Business Card.‚Äù
But what will you do if your Brand SERP displays a negative review on the first page? Or what choices will you make if Google shows a bland, irrelevant Brand SERP, even after you have put in the time, resources, and effort to revamp it?
When first building their Brand SERP, many people become frustrated or discouraged at how much effort is required and how long the process takes. The methods I‚Äôve explained in this book are incredibly powerful, but like anything worth doing, they require time, effort, dedication, and patience. Even with massive input, your timeframe is months and years, rather than days.

     It‚Äôs only natural for some businesses to cheat to save time and resources and ‚Äúbeat the system.‚Äù But if you are tempted, ask yourself this: What is the potential cost? The answer: Your entire brand reputation.
This is one of the most important points I impress upon clients: when working on your Brand SERP (and therefore your brand‚Äôs credibility in the eyes of your audience and Google) do not, under any circumstances, try to cheat and sneak around Google. Notice I used the words ‚Äútry to.‚Äù
In this context, shortcuts rarely work for short-term benefits and never work for long-term ones. In other areas of life‚Äîsay when taking a test or playing a game‚Äîcheating is a calculated risk, one with either a positive or negative outcome. However, your Brand SERP is different; cheating will always hit you where it hurts. The only uncertainty is how long it will take Google to find and reflect your deceit in your Brand SERP for your audience to see. This ‚Äútrickery‚Äù against Google will cause long-term damage to your credibility with your audience and tarnish your trustworthiness with Google.
When you cheat your Brand SERP, you are cheating in full and open view of Google. Your Brand SERP is Google‚Äôs representation of your reputation. Cheat on that and you‚Äôll end up shooting yourself in the foot. Imagine you‚Äôre cheating on a test while your teacher stares at you the whole time. Like the teacher, Google will catch you no matter how smart you think your tactics are. Google is watching you. It created the ‚Äúgame,‚Äù and it is in control of the examination room. Google holds all of the cards, so if you want to win the ‚ÄúGoogle game,‚Äù play the game by Google‚Äôs rules.
 
 Google controls your digital business card, and if you cheat, it will present you as a cheater to your real life audience. And that has the potential to kill your business.
Cheating at Google‚Äôs Game
In SEO, cheat tactics are called Black Hat. Black Hat tactics are designed to find weaknesses in Google‚Äôs algorithms and exploit them to create artificially improved results.
Ever since the start of the internet, people have developed Black Hat tactics to trick Google‚Äôs algorithms. They have been able to ‚Äúturn the tables‚Äù on Google. This is impressive, especially considering Google‚Äôs multi-billion-dollar technology and reputation. Even so, these cheats aren‚Äôt a sustainable marketing strategy for a legitimate business.
Black Hat tactics are designed to find weaknesses in Google‚Äôs algorithms and exploit them to create artificially improved results.
Even though these techniques can bring short-term wins if Google has not immediately noticed your tricks, it will eventually cotton on and the brand reputation you worked so hard to build will crumble. Your Brand SERP will turn ‚Äúsour‚Äù and may become negative quickly. At this point, you will totally lose Google‚Äôs trust, and it will present you negatively on your Brand SERP. Just like in life, winning back trust you have lost is one of the hardest tasks you‚Äôll ever undertake.
  


     You might think you can just close your website and start afresh. Wrong. Google remembers you and your brand as entities, meaning Google knows who you are and won‚Äôt forget it. With the implementation of entity-based search (the Hummingbird update), any bad reputation you earned from cheating will follow your brand for the rest of its online life (so, forever).
The end of every cheater‚Äôs story is the same: if you try to trick Google, you will sabotage your trustworthiness and ‚Äúkill‚Äù your reputation, causing permanent damage to your Brand SERP. With this perspective, building a Brand SERP the correct way doesn‚Äôt seem so laborious.
Black Hat Marketed as a Quick Fix
When trying to make their Brand SERP ‚Äúsexy‚Äù or drown negative search results, brand owners will typically encounter agencies offering Black Hat tactics. It is understandable to see these cheating techniques as a ‚Äúquick fix‚Äù to drown high-ranking unfavorable articles, reviews, or comments. Generally speaking, the Black Hat strategy will be to flood Google with so much new, positive content that the negative result gets pushed down and replaced. This often takes the form of paid-for articles or blog posts, which are very costly and rarely rank on a Brand SERP.
Google wants to show the most helpful, relevant, and valuable results to your audience. With that outlook, brand new content on irrelevant sites won‚Äôt make sense to Google. And even if Google did think these additional sites provided value to your audience, the sheer volume of this mediocre content will mean it has little or



 no impact on your Brand SERP‚Äîyou can create 10 great articles about your brand, but Google cannot show them all.
Hiring a company that promises to remove a negative result in a few weeks may seem like a clever ‚Äúhack,‚Äù but their techniques make no sense in your Brand SERP strategy, nor do they make good business sense. These companies generally operate against Google‚Äôs guidelines, which, of course, are not laws nor absolute orders. However, since you are asking Google to present your brand in a positive light, you are effectively playing its ‚Äúgame,‚Äù and Google defines the rules. Break those rules at your own risk.
While Black Hat strategies can sometimes successfully break the rules and outsmart the algorithms over a short time period, the long-term effects are always negative for a legitimate business hoping to present their audience with a great ‚ÄúGoogle Business Card.‚Äù If you are too obvious or greedy, Google may even totally ban your site short-term.
Setting aside your Brand SERP, you also must consider your human audience. If a spam article does rank, then how will your audience perceive it? With the internet full of spammers and scammers, users are constantly on high alert for malware and suspicious content. If your Brand SERP appears fake or cheated, readers will certainly get a bad impression of your brand and navigate away from you.
  

     The Principal Self-Sabotaging Black Hat Strategies to Avoid
To refrain from damaging your reputation in Google‚Äôs eyes, you should avoid three main categories of Black Hat tactics. Importantly, these serve as the antithesis to the three SEO pillars in the earlier chapter about SEO1:
1. Creating False Understanding: Placing false information on third-party sites trusted by Google (such as Wikipedia) to trick Google into believing misinformation and portraying you more favorably to its users.
2. Buying Credibility: Paying an individual or company to link to your content or provide you with fake reviews to make your brand seem more recommendable.
3. Feigning Suitability: Creating texts that are designed to trick Google into thinking you provide a relevant and helpful solution to its users when, in fact, you don‚Äôt.
Black Hat tactics like these are a common form of cheating used by business owners to try and manipulate Google‚Äôs appreciation of their brand and their content. As Google evolves and changes, so will the methods used to exploit its algorithm. New ideas and ‚ÄúSERP hacks‚Äù are created and tested every day, and although they sometimes work short term, in a world where Google understands who you are, it is extremely dangerous to associate your brand with them.
1 As a refresher, these three pillars are: Understanding, Credibility, and Sustainability.

 The next page details some of the most common cheats from 2021, many of which promise sure-fire ‚Äúwins‚Äù on Brand SERPs. Assuming you have a long-term, customer-centric brand strategy, you should avoid them despite their popularity.
Constructing Artificial Credibility Through Private Blog Networks and Buying Links
Private Blog Networks, or PBNs, are dedicated websites that serve no other purpose than to post links to increase the rankings of one or more websites. Google uses links to help determine a website‚Äôs credibility, so PBNs can potentially allow you to amplify a website‚Äôs credibility artificially. However, while PBNs seem tempting, experienced consultants can spot them within minutes. This trick worked for years, but Google has gotten smarter. Now, PBNs are glaringly apparent to Google too.
Buying links goes hand-in-hand with using PBNs and is just as dangerous. When looking to improve your brand‚Äôs credibility in Google‚Äôs eyes, you may stumble across sellers who claim they can provide amazing, authoritative links for low prices. As with all SEO and Brand SERP tactics (and most things in life), if it looks too good to be true, then it is a too-good-to-be-true scam.
While these sellers will post links to your site for suspiciously affordable prices, the links will be obviously unnatural and will add absolutely no value to your brand. They will appear in irrelevant, scattered places across the internet, such as random forum threads, comment sections, directory links, and dubious websites. The seller may even post them on a PBN, which just compounds the problem.
  
     Cheap links are a waste of money and a detriment to your brand. Not only will they fail in their main objective, but they‚Äôll signal to Google that you‚Äôre manipulating the system.
To Spam or Not to Spam
It‚Äôs not much of a question; spam is the wrong approach for any business building a respectable brand with long-term ambition. Once you are labeled as a cheat, it becomes difficult to repair this impression. In the summer of 2021, Google implemented a new spam-centric update to prevent link manipulation and content spam. Increasingly, if Google‚Äôs algorithms classify your brand or website as spam, it will automatically exclude you from the search results without warning or notice. The best way to prevent this drastic consequence is to instead use traditional marketing strategies such as brand building and client satisfaction. Avoid Black Hat tactics like PBNs, automatically generated content, and cheap links.
Every single action you take, including any cheating tactics, is directly and forever tied to your brand, a.k.a. your biggest asset. If you attempt to cheat Google, your brand will be associated with this mistake forever.


 Negative SEO
Some brands really push Black Hat to a darker level and aim to damage their competitor‚Äôs Brand SERPs with negative SEO. While some use the term ‚Äúnegative SEO‚Äù as a synonym for Black Hat methods, they are not synonymous. Whereas Black Hat aims to improve the performance for an owned brand, negative SEO aims to attack and damage another brand‚Äôs SEO. Someone who uses a negative SEO campaign against a competitor is aiming to convince Google‚Äôs algorithms that the target brand is not credible or is using Black Hat cheat techniques. This could involve creating untrustworthy backlinks and pointing them towards their competitor, fabricating harsh 1-star reviews, or building fake duplicate websites in an attempt to damage their competitor‚Äôs ranking. Some even go so far as to hack, or hire someone else to hack, their competitor‚Äôs website and vandalize their SEO performance.
Avoid this approach. If you take a negative SEO approach to target your direct competitors, it‚Äôs very possible that your competitor will catch you, and they will retaliate through negative SEO tactics of their own or even take legal action against you.
If you think you can be ‚Äúsneaky‚Äù in your deception, you‚Äôre wrong. Negative and Black Hat SEO always leave behind a permanent, identifiable digital footprint. Anything you implement today will be visible to Google, your competition, your audience, and the courts in 10 or 20 years‚Äô time.
  

     Except for the rare exception, the legal system is not going to offer much help, even for the targets of these attacks. Unfortunately, involving lawyers typically does not solve the problem in a timely, productive manner. In fact, the opposite is true. The judicial process costs a fortune, wastes valuable time, and almost never ends in a win. Even at the best of times, the legal process is slow, costly, and cumbersome. In the context of the internet, legal proceedings get significantly worse.
Legal action is not a ‚Äúquick fix.‚Äù The better approach is to counter the attack online by working to absolutely dominate your own Brand SERP and leave no space for intruders.
While the law slowly evolves via legislation, the internet is changing constantly, thus the law never really keeps up. This problem is compounded by the fact that judges don‚Äôt necessarily understand the new laws or have familiarity with how the internet actually works, which can slow down the legal proceedings or impact your chance of success. Then there‚Äôs the additional complication of finding a lawyer who understands the situation enough to leverage the relevant legislation to win the case. And the killer problem is, even if you win the case, it will take years and cost a fortune to enforce the judgement. More often than not, the offending article will have been replaced on the SERP before the court case has any effect.
Whether tied to negative or Black Hat SEO, every single action you take, including any cheating tactics and court cases, is directly and forever tied to your brand, a.k.a. your biggest asset. If you attempt to cheat Google, your brand will be associated with this mistake forever. Google has been watching you since the first day you appeared online, and it‚Äôs not about to ‚Äúforget‚Äù about your brand.


We are playing Google‚Äôs game, so for sustainable, long-term results, we must play by Google‚Äôs rules. Google is a sophisticated machine that‚Äôs continually getting smarter, making it increasingly difficult to trick or cheat. Risk-free shortcuts in Brand SERP management frankly do not exist, and in my experience, everyone who cheats on their Brand SERP always learns this same lesson:
Even if you ‚Äúturn a trick‚Äù today, cleaning up the residual mess long term is far more costly than any short-term gains."
Explanation of Why the Search result for your Brand Name is Fundamentally important in the Context of Brand SERP Optimisation for Google and Bing	"An online business presence is no longer optional; it‚Äôs a necessity. Before customers make purchases and spend their money, they will always pull out their phones and do a quick informational search to evaluate a brand‚Äôs message and reputation.
‚Ä¢ What message does Google portray to your audience when they search your brand?
- Are they able to learn the basics about you?
- Is the information accurate?
‚Ä¢ What does your ‚ÄúGoogle Business Card‚Äù look like?
- Is the message clear? Convincing?
These questions can be the make or break of a sale. But beyond that, the answers to these questions can shape your entire digital content strategy.
Brand SERP optimisation is the foundation of your online brand management. Improvements to your Brand SERP have a domino effect, expanding out to improve your SEO performances and your overarching online marketing strategy. Getting the initial domino in place is crucial for the rest of the strategy to succeed. By improving your Google Business Card for your audience, the rest will naturally fall into place and your wider SEO, content strategy, and online reputation will become a triple-threat against your competitors.

     You need to educate Google before it can present your audience with an accurate, positive, and convincing representation of your Brand SERP. The process is simple, but it requires you to invest time and resources into a meaningful and effective digital strategy that serves your Brand SERP.
In the competitive world of business, you don‚Äôt want to leave your brand‚Äôs message to chance, so you need to build a positive digital ecosystem and manage your Brand SERP proactively.
This process involves:
‚Ä¢ Optimising
- Your Homepage
- Rich Sitelinks
- Your Social Media Accounts
- Google Ads
‚Ä¢ Improving
- Search Results (the ones you control and those you don‚Äôt)
- Your Content Strategy
- Audience Participation
‚Ä¢ Employing
- Simple SEO Tactics across the board
‚Ä¢ Engaging your audience with relevant content
‚Ä¢ Avoiding
- Cutting Corners with Cheats


 Since your Brand SERP reflects the world‚Äôs opinion of your brand, you absolutely must develop a diverse, active, and attractive digital ecosystem that truly engages your audience. Any content you produce must support your brand, be relatable for your audience, and add at least one small brick to building a consistent, accurate, positive, and convincing brand message.
The anatomy of a Brand SERP is based on the fundamental principle of Darwinism. If your Brand SERP is imperfect, then it has evolved to be imperfect. Unlike Darwinism, you can take control and change the course of natural selection by adapting your brand‚Äôs digital strategy.
You may be tempted to cut corners and cheat to expedite your online presence. Don‚Äôt. Competitor envy will only hurt your credibility and long-term success. It‚Äôs like a horse looking left and right during a race. Distracted like this, the horse will trip itself up. That‚Äôs why they wear blinders: to focus on what they are doing, where they are, and where they are going. Until you‚Äôve sorted out your own horse, put your competitors out of your mind and concentrate on your own Brand SERP.
Whatever the weaknesses and strengths, you can change the course of evolution and focus on your brand-building goals. From bluelinks to Rich Elements (Video Boxes, Twitter Boxes, and even Knowledge Panels), you now have the power to manipulate the anatomy of your Brand SERP and design your Google Business Card, making it a ‚Äúsexy‚Äù and powerful asset for your business.


     This book is exclusively about Google to keep the approach (relatively) uncomplicated. Even by narrowing the topic down to one search engine, there was a lot of content to cover in one book! But if you think back to the introduction, I mentioned that 1 billion people use Bing every month. This statistic means your Bing Business Card is incredibly important too and shouldn‚Äôt be pushed to one side as an afterthought. Au contraire: up to 10% of your audience uses Bing, and some people use multiple search engines in tandem. Even if Google dominates the industry, other search engines can still provide value to your brand and shouldn‚Äôt be dismissed.
Luckily, Bing and Google function in much the same manner, so everything you do to improve your Brand SERP on Google will help improve your Brand SERP on Bing (and vice versa). It‚Äôs a two birds, one stone kind of win that will improve your business‚Äôs online performance.
When you get it ‚Äúright,‚Äù both Bing and Google will represent you in a positive light to their users. Each search engine will offer you incredible insights into what their users (and your audience) value, while also providing you with an independent evaluation of how the world perceives your brand.
This book and my courses are only the first steps to demystifying how Google, Bing, Yahoo and other search engines depict online brands. As search engines continue to improve their techniques for learning about and representing brands, Brand SERP strategies will evolve. To stay up to date on how to maintain your Brand SERP so it presents an accurate, clear, and compelling representation of your brand, the ultimate weapon is the SaaS platform, Kalicube Pro, which uses fresh data and up-to-the-minute techniques.

The Fundamentals of Brand SERPs for Business

For anyone I missed, I apologise in advance. Please let me know. I‚Äôll publish another book about Knowledge Panels soon. I can make amends there‚Äîit is a more academic topic, so is arguably a better place to be cited. In that context, this might actually be an unexpected ‚Äúwin‚Äù for you. :)"
Overview of how to deal with suboptimal content on a Brand SERP on Google	"In this course, we will look at how to deal with suboptimal content that is sitting on page #1 of your Brand SERP.

When I say suboptimal, I mean not only content that is negative, but also content that is inaccurate or simply not attractive for your audience. Anything that makes your Brand SERP less good that it should be.

The first lessons in this course deal with improving what actually appears on your Brand SERP. Improving the look of the SERP is the first, most important step. Make that first impression count. 

The second part of this course deals will removing the result. 
If the result looks less-than-perfect on your SERP and you can‚Äôt improve how it looks, then you need to push it down and off the page. 
Taking it further, even if the result looks OK on the SERP, but the content of the page behind the link is negative, then you really want to get that result off your SERP.

I‚Äôll cover both in this course.
When improving how a result appears on your SERP, the results can be very quick if you have control. If you don‚Äôt, then the changes take longer, just be realistic and a little patient. 

Removing the result is all about leapfrogging that unwanted content and pushing it down off your SERP. This process is necessarily slower since we are working on Google‚Äôs ranking, and like any SEO work, the changes are not instantaneous. 

It‚Äôs worth pointing out that whenever any rankings change, they tend to be a little unstable initially. When you first manage to push that unwanted result down your SERP, Google will do A/B testing to check to see if the new ranking is good for its users. So it will pop back up intermittently over time and for different people. It won‚Äôt settle down for a few days, or perhaps even weeks. 

On a similar tack, even when you‚Äôve succeeded and the SERP looks better, don‚Äôt think the job is over. Things change over time that might push the result back up - a change in Google‚Äôs algorithm might favour the unwanted result, or the owner of the result might implement some SEO improvements and push it back up onto your SERP. 

Either way, I recommend that you maintain some ongoing work to KEEP that unwanted result down - both by continuing to improve the SEO of the content you have pushed above it, and by working on pushing even more content above the suboptimal result so that it becomes well and truly buried.

You might also be worried about the fact that people DO click on these results. And they do.
You may have seen statistics about click through rates on different positions in SERPs. A typical example would give a 25% click through rate on position 1‚Ä¶ and that leaves 75% for the other results, which seems a lot !

In reality, things aren‚Äôt quite that simple, especially on Brand SERPs. 

Here‚Äôs an overview of a typical case for a Brand SERP. The homepage and sitelink block dominates, and between 35% and 60% of people click on that. The intent of the user is to find your site, or find out about you, so that makes total sense.
 
 A further 30% of people don‚Äôt click on any of the results and they continue searching on Google. There are many reasons for this. Here are three 

1- they found the information they wanted - your address, or phone number for example - so there is no need to visit your site, or any other site, for that matter
2 - they don‚Äôt see what they are looking for and refine their search - who is the CEO of Disney, or where do I apply for a job at Disney
3 - Google suggested another search that grabbed their interest - perhaps a ‚ÄúPeople Also Ask‚Äù block, or ‚ÄúRelated Searches‚Äù 

That leaves only 10 to 35% of people who actually click and visit one of the other sites that appear. And that 10 to 35% is divided between ALL the other results. Each one will get anything from almost zero percent of clicks if they are right at the bottom, to perhaps as high as 5% for a result that stands out from the crowd.

These figures are approximations, and actual figures for individual Brand SERPs will vary. It simply serves to indicate that what people see at a glance on your Brand SERP is the biggest single question here, and that relatively few people click on links other than the brand, especially if the Brand SERP looks convincing.

You can check the percentage of clicks your homepage block gets like this :

That will give you an idea of how many people click on the other results, and how damaging that unwanted result really is. Some people do click on it, but perhaps less than you thought. I‚Äôm not saying it isn‚Äôt important. It is VITALLY important from multiple perspectives.

Anyone searching your brand name sees it and that leaves a negative impression in their mind.
And then, anyone who clicks on it is probably researching you, and if the content is very negative, that potential conversion might well be a lost opportunity now.

Beyond those purely practical questions, the fact that this bad result ranks indicates that Google believes that the content is relevant and accurate. By improving it, you improve Google‚Äôs perception of you. And when you work to push other content above it, your are convincing Google THAT content is more relevant and representative.
 
Either way, you are improving Google‚Äôs opinion of you.

So, suboptimal content can be something outright negative, but also a competitor, something inaccurate, or simply something that isn‚Äôt overtly positive about you. In short anything YOU don‚Äôt like.

Now, a little bit of misquoted philosophy from Confucius. 
Identify the results you can change and change them. Identify those you cannot change and drown them. 

Making changes 
For some, you can improve them, either directly or indirectly. 
Simply getting the meta title and description improved means that people Googling your brand name see a more attractive SERP. 

You‚Äôve dealt with the most visible part  and that‚Äôs a nice, satisfying quick short term win for you.

You can, and should, take this further. In the lessons I also provide techniques for improving the content on those pages.
 From the standpoint of E-A-T (Expertise, Authority and Trust), it is important to minimise any negativity attached to your brand.

Removing the result.
For any result that doesn‚Äôt reflect positively on your brand, you really do want to act to get it off your Brand SERP. Even if it isn‚Äôt outright negative, you want that Brand SERP to be the perfect representation of your brand. Accurate, positive and TRULY convincing to your audience. 

There are three things you can do here
1 - Leapfrogging it using the leapfrogging techniques in this course
2 - Create new content that will outrank and drown it
3 - Trigger rich elements that drowns and potentially reduces the number of results on your Brand SERP

Whichever you use, once you have removed one result from page #1, think about creating a  cushion of quality content above it. REALLY bury it, perhaps right down at the bottom of page 2‚Ä¶ make it so the result will never make it back.

Explanation of how to deal with negative forum threads about your brand	"There is a forum thread from a third party on your Brand SERP and it looks negative

The first thing to bear in mind is that, even though you don‚Äôt agree, and you think this is unfair, remember that forum threads are all about opinions and people are free to express their opinions. 

We all have a tendency to focus on positive opinions about us and we tend to ignore negative opinions when we can. In this case, when you've got this forum thread ranking very high on your Brand SERP, you can‚Äôt afford to ignore it. 

In this lesson, I‚Äôll look at how best to deal with it and reduce the damage it is doing in the short term. Longer term, you definitely want to drown it. Watch the leapfrogging lessons for more on how to do that.

It‚Äôs important to bear in mind that behind every comment is a person. Behind the negative comments we are dealing with is a person with a bad experience with your brand. They've written on a forum because they are angry and upset - something in your service or product didn‚Äôt live up to their expectations. They're unhappy with what you've provided and their opinion is valid. You might not agree, but it's still a valid opinion. 

 The problem you need to face is that, once one person with a negative opinion creates a forum thread, it can spiral quickly out of control. And the more people contribute to that thread, the higher it will rank on your Brand SERP.

It sounds facile, but keeping customers happy has to be the foundation of any long-term business strategy. The visible side of satisfying clients and keeping them happy is great reviews. The invisible side is avoiding bad feedback of all sorts - on social media, in reviews, but also negative forum threads. 

There will always be some negative forum threads about a brand. 
Why do they sometimes appear on Brand SERPs?

One reason is that they are fresh. Another is popularity. Both of those make the thread relevant for searches on your brand name. 

Once a thread gets popular, people contribute with new comments. And once a forum thread starts getting updated regularly, that makes it fresh and it gets visibility on the platform and on Google, and that means more people see it and contribute, and that makes it fresh AND popular‚Ä¶ 

it‚Äôs a spiralling cycle‚Ä¶ and Google sees this as a signal that the thread is relevant and important - and therefore a great candidate for ranking on your Brand SERP. Once up on your Brand SERP, an active thread is very difficult to push down off your Brand SERP. 

Worse, a thread starts with one single person who is angry. But negativity attracts negativity‚Ä¶  lots of people will jump on the bandwagon. 
Few people will spontaneously defend you. And even if they do, the sentiment they express is highly unlikely to be as strong as the negative opinions. A thread that starts badly usually gets worse.

So what can you do?

First is to minimise the damage. 
Second is to push it off the SERP. 

In this lesson, I will explain how to minimise the immediate on-SERP damage. For the mid to long term, you really want to push it down off the SERP. Watch the leapfrogging lessons for more about how to do that. 

First thing to do is to open communication with the people on the thread

You need to engage with these people and start the process of calming things down. That usually means introducing some context and a little perspective. 

Do that by replying to the initial post - be tactful, though. The person isn‚Äôt wrong, they are simply not telling the whole story. Tactfully indicating that the situation isn‚Äôt quite so black and white is a great way to calm the thread down, and helpfully replying to the initial post shows that you are open to discuss, and that you want to resolve the problem - that‚Äôs a good signal to the community and to Google.

Don't argue your point of view. Don‚Äôt complain and justify yourself in public. Most of all, don't criticize the person directly. You are already seen to be the bad guy here, so don't argue the point. If they were angry to start with, that is nothing compared to how angry they will get if you start a fight in public. 
Stay reasonable, offer solutions and avoid criticising, however much they criticise you. That is the best way to calm things down.

Try to take this negative dialogue off the thread. Offer to engage through email, or by phone. Engaging with people on the forum runs the risk of making things a lot worse. The initial part of your dialogue is probably going to be quite negative. 
If possible, it is better to keep that negative conversation private - and definitely off the forum thread. If you can, bring them back onto the forum when you have calmed things down, and they're in a more positive frame of mind. 

Next, reply to the other comments, both negative and positive. Engage with everyone in the conversation. Move any negative conversations away from public view, and push the conversation back onto the thread once the tone is positive. 

Several things you‚Äôll want to consider here. 
1 - people have vented their anger, and aren‚Äôt necessarily interested in engaging with you

2 - you don‚Äôt need everyone to be overly positive and sing your praises - that would seem suspicious :) Your aim is to get them to give a more balanced view.

3 - the process is step by step, comment by comment... person by person - remember every contributor is a person who has a complaint about your products and service.

4 - it takes time. You cannot change the tone of a thread with one comment. Each time you reply, each time you can get one contributor to calm down, the tone of the thread changes for the better. Over time that becomes noticeable to both the audience and to Google.

If you can't calm things down, even by being super-tactful, if these people are so angry and upset that they can no longer even start to contemplate your point of view, then you need to stop. 
You REALLY don't want to poke a wasps nest. They‚Äôll get more angry and their comments will become even more vitriolic and damaging. Plus, you're just keeping the content fresh and that result will become even MORE sticky on your Brand SERP. 

Next option is to ask the forum owner

Getting the thread changed by the person who truly controls it is by far the best option But it is also very difficult. The key here is building a relationship with the forum owner. Without any relationship, you have no chance. With a relationship, you might be able to convince them to improve things.

I have seen site owners helping brands right off the bat when the thread is obviously excessive or unfair. But more often than not, you need to build some kind of relationship with the owner and get them on your side, and convince them that this thread is bad for them.  They have to see that intervening is beneficial to them‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs in THEIR interest. We‚Äôll look at that later on in this lesson.

What can we realistically ask them to change?
The most important thing is to get them to change the meta title and description since that is what is most visible on your Brand SERP. 

You can‚Äôt really ask them to misrepresent the thread. But you can reasonably ask them to change it to be a more balanced reflection of the tone of the thread - and that works particularly well when you have done your work on the thread that I explained earlier - the thread will give a more balanced opinion of your brand and products than the initial post. 

And there‚Äôs the key. More often than not, the metas are taken from the initial post. That is rarely an accurate representation once you have calmed things down and other people have added their thoughts to the forum thread. Surprisingly, forum owners are actually open to this idea. The role of their site is to show a representative community-based view, so more balanced metas makes absolute sense to them. 

In this case, we've got them to change the meta title and description to make them less aggressive. We've created a slight problem because there has been an update, and that makes the content fresh‚Ä¶  but changing the metas is a big short term win. It's no longer absolutely killing our Brand SERP.

One thing that tends to stick around is the URL. It is usually the title of the initial comment, and if that is negative, even if you get the title and description changed, the negative message is still visible on your SERP. Ask to have that changed. But bear in mind this is a REALLY big ask. Changing the URL requires some technical implementation on their part, and that is usually too much to ask.

I mentioned making this beneficial to the site owner. 
So, as you just saw, if you approach this well, you can reasonably ask the owner to change the presentation on the SERP.
You can also try to get them to remove the worst content - but you need to approach it from their point of view - they need to clearly see some benefit that serves their self-interest.

Bear in mind that this is a LONG way from being a priority for them. They have thousands, possibly millions of threads to deal with. They are not going to be instinctively enthusiastic about this one single thread. You have to make it important to them.

Also, don't demand changes or bully. However much you think you are in the right, this won‚Äôt work. Be empathetic and look at this from the site owner‚Äôs point of view. 
And don‚Äôt call the lawyers - watch the lesson about Tactics to Avoid and Mistakes not to Make in the fundamentals course to understand why that is a spectacularly bad idea. 

ANY positive changes you can get are well worth taking. You are in the weak position here. Getting the meta title and description changed is obviously the aim of the game, but anything that makes this thread less poisonous will reduce its capacity to rank on your Brand SERP‚Ä¶ and every negative mention you can have removed is very good for your business. 

So, even if you can‚Äôt get the metas changed and make your SERP look better, it is well worth removing individual comments.
That‚Äôs because, beyond your Brand SERP, these threads affect your business. People see them. Your reputation in their eyes suffers every time someone adds a negative comment to a thread like this. 

But also, Google sees them. And Google uses your reputation as part of its ranking algorithm.

Here's some possible angles you can consider when approaching a site owner

1 - Prove that it‚Äôs a truly unfair representation. This one is tough. You can see it is unfair. But anyone who doesn‚Äôt know your company as well as you do won‚Äôt see it. You have to prove that this is unfair from a completely impartial viewpoint. If you are to have any hope, you MUST take a big step back and look at your brand, your products and your services with completely impartially. That is possible, but VERY hard to do. I would suggest getting outside help.

2 - Show the site owner that it's black hat or spam. Forum owners don‚Äôt want black hat or spam on their site. This is an ongoing, and very annoying fight for them. If you can demonstrate that you are helping them reduce abuse on their platform, they will be very receptive.

3 - Bad language. Few people want bad language on their site. Comments that include bad language are often excessive, and are great candidates for complete removal.That is the best case for you. But they might put asterisks in the place of the rude word. Even that is worth taking.

4 - Excessive - if someone is going too far and vindictive - this is actually quite common and is easy to spot‚Ä¶vindictive people keep adding to the thread without any reason. Point that out to the site owner.

5 - False claims. if a comment is provably false, it is a good candidate for removal. Once again, you need to take a big step back and be neutral in order to argue a case like this.

6 - If the person is not really a client, you can potentially get the form of an owner to remove it. Hard to prove, but if you are sure about it, then it‚Äôs worth a try.

7 - Negative SEO - if you can prove it, this is a no-brainer for the site owner. Nobody wants to be used as a platform for negative SEO. It is VERY damaging for their global SEO strategy, and they will be happy to remove it. 

Always bear in mind that they TRULY don't care that it's damaging you. Put yourself in their shoes and explain it to them from their point of view. Demonstrate that it's damaging for them.  

If they do help you, the result will start to look a little bit better - short term.

But whatever the outcome of your exchanges with the forum owner, you definitely want to push this result off the first page of your Brand SERP.

So, whilst you are talking to the forum owner, work on drowning the thread using the leapfrogger technique that I explain in this course."
Explanation of online reviews about your company or products	"We're looking at platforms that collect reviews from your audience about your brand. This lesson doesn't cover individual reviews by journalists or bloggers - those are covered in the lesson about blogs and articles on your Brand SERPs. 

Reputable review platforms are good candidates for ranking on your Brand SERP. Great stuff. But the knife cuts both ways. A review platform showing high scores for your brand is very positive and very convincing for users and Google. One showing low scores for your brand is very, very negative.

There are three main types of review platform that tend to rank well on Brand SERPs. 

Firstly, service reviews
These are an evaluation or an opinion about your overall service, or your overall brand. Service reviews are a rating of how well your company treats your customers. That includes not only sales and after sales service, but that rating also includes your clients‚Äô perception of your site - which is especially important if they make an online purchase without ever talking to your staff. 

And that last point is a GREAT reason to invest a lot of effort into an amazing UX on your site right from the landing page, through the checkout process, to the confirmation page, the email confirmation and any follow up emails.
You might have a low fail rate for checkout confirmations, or email delivery, or any other part of your sales process - but however few fails you have, each fail is a person, and that person is a client who can give a service review. Remember that when it goes wrong for them, and they are frustrated by that, a bad review is the probable outcome.

Secondly, product reviews. 
Obviously that's about your products. These are much less likely to rank on you Brand SERP. If they DO, then adapt the approach I set out here to that product. 

If you are uni product, service sector business, the distinction might not be clear in your mind. So, a quick clarification on the term ‚ÄúService review‚Äù 
If your product is a service such as a consultant, or a plumber, then the term service reviews is confusing. The distinction is that, in the case of a service as a product, the ‚Äúproduct review‚Äù is the quality of the work you did, and the service review is how well your company treated the customer.

Thirdly, employee review sites
These rank quite well, especially if they have managed to collect a lot of employee reviews. And this context, a dozen is a lot. Glassdoor is an example that comes up in Brand SERPs time and again.

Whatever the type of review platform, low scoring review stars look very on your Brand SERP and send out a very negative signal to people Googling your brand name. 

This one star looks very bad‚Ä¶
Even three-stars still looks bad...
When you get four stars, that's where things start to look good. 

Importantly, review platforms rank well on Brand SERPs today‚Ä¶ and they are not going away anytime soon. Data from accuRanker indicates that over 75% of Brand SERPs contain review stars, and the review stars are drawn from these review platforms. So you have to face up to these platforms, and make sure your clients are sufficiently happy with your products and services to give you a great review‚Ä¶ every time. As we‚Äôll see, just a few unhappy customers can easily ruin your rating.

A quick side note - up to September 2019, brands could cheat and get stars on their own Brand SERP. But then Google updated their approach to how they display service level review stars in the SERPs. As of September 2019, Google no longer shows the review stars if the page is on the brand‚Äôs site. So even if you create a reviews page on your site, add genuine reviews to it and get it to rank on your Brand SERP, you won‚Äôt see the stars on the SERP. 

What if you have a low scoring platform on page 1
Several choices - 

Firstly, improve the score on that platform. That‚Äôs covered in this lesson.

Secondly, encourage Google to rank another platform in its place - Google is unlikely put more than 1 or 2 review platforms on your exact match Brand SERP - so give it a reason to put another platform in the place of the negative one‚Ä¶ make another relevant platform irresistible to Google. 
Two factors come into play - how relevant the platform is to your industry, and the sheer volume of reviews that platform has for your brand. 
A relevant platform with significant number of positive reviews is a stunningly good candidate for your Brand SERP.

Thirdly, you can drown it by using the leapfrog technique. Watch the lessons in this course about leapfrogging to see how to do that.

Reviews, Maths and Scoring
For any review platform, at low levels of engagement by your clients, it's all a bit death or glory - the margins are very thin and ratings can ‚Äòflip‚Äô from positive to negative very easily‚Ä¶  so be aware of the task ahead. 

Here's some maths. Don't worry if you aren‚Äôt comfortable with Maths, this is a kind of maths story.

The story is that the less reviews you have on a platform, the easier it is for a great rating can flip to a bad one. If you can get a lot of reviews the rating will be MUCH more stable. So the aim is to collect a large number of 4 and 5 star reviews on any given platform to keep your ratings - and visible reputation - positive and stable.

Now for the sums. I hope I've made it reasonably simple and illustrative. 

Let‚Äôs look at a bad result. Starting off with a single one star review, you have a 20% average. That‚Äôs bad.
If you then get one five star review, what happens?
You have one one very happy client and you might think that counter-balances the unhappy client. Unfortunately review stars and ratings are FAR from a one-to-one trade off. 
You now have 60% - that's three stars. 
That wonderful five star review hasn't completely drowned the one star review. And result still looks bad on your SERP.

If you get another five star review, that's really nice. But what's your score now? 
Two five star reviews STILL can‚Äôt counteract the single one star review. Your rating is still only 73% - that‚Äôs still in the 3 star bracket - you're still not looking good enough. 

4 stars is the lowest bar that I consider ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù. Anything below makes people think twice about you brand.

So the ratio is 3 great reviews for every bad review.

That doesn't seem too bad, but if the next reviewer only gives you a one star review... Look what happens. It drops quite a long way. Well below that four star target you‚Äôre aiming for. 

Five star reviews are pretty hard to get. Getting four star reviews might appear to be enough, but once you have any single review that's below four stars, no number of four star reviews, will EVER get your average back up to four. So relying on your clients to give you 4 stars isn‚Äôt going to work.

Look at this data. I know it's a bit complicated, but look how slowly that average creeps up with each additional very good four star review‚Ä¶
and with ONLY 4 star reviews, it will never get to four. You need 5 stars in the mix.

In this typical example, I need six five star reviews to actually get that average back up to four‚Ä¶ and I need to get 15 extra reviews to achieve that. That's quite a big ask.

That‚Äôs at low volumes.
What happens if we scale up a bit. Imagine that you have a hundred reviews already collected, and the average score is three. NOW look at how slowly that average rises with each additional review. Very, VERY slowly. 

The good news is that any new one star reviews don't have much impact. The bad news is that neither do the 4 and 5 star reviews ! So, you need boatloads of reviews and you need a lot of five star reviews. 

Now, a word of warning‚Ä¶  even when you're in a seemingly safe situation, you need to keep your eye on the ball
This example appears to be plain sailing at 4.1 stars, but it doesn't take much to ruin that and drop below the 4 star score that ‚Äúwins and keeps customers‚Äù.

In this example, just 4 one star reviews pulls that seemingly safe score below the average we are looking for. And once you've dropped below - even if it's only a tiny bit below - getting back is tough. In this example, it takes another FOURTEEN five-star reviews in a row to get back to your starting position again and feel relatively safe. 

In short - Review scores are very hard to build up, very easy to lose... and they're very hard to regain when you do lose them. 
The more reviews you have on a platform, the more stable your rating will be, and the more you can happily welcome that platform on your SERP. 

The general rules. And these are quite scary, so take a big breath :)
As a general rule of thumb, if you are to have positive-looking ratings on a review site, then  the ratio of good reviews to bad is 3 to 1. 
Doesn‚Äôt seem TOO scary. But that doesn‚Äôt mean making three quarters of your clients VERY happy‚Ä¶ unhappy clients are MUCH more likely to give you a review. And however much you encourage your happy clients, the ratio of happy clients giving you a review is always much lower than for unhappy clients. 

A realistic ratio of unhappy to happy client‚Äôs you need to aim for is closer to 9 to 1.
And just to push the point, that one bad review can be triggered from any single less-than-perfect experience with you. 

Let‚Äôs say there are 12 touch points during and after purchase. That‚Äôs 12 opportunities to get things wrong. Any one of those 12 can trigger a negative review. None will ever trigger a positive review on its own - to get a great review, you have to get all 12 100% right.
Scary stuff."
Explanation of how to deal with negative online reviews about your brand or company	"Within the scope of this course - if a platform that shows a low rating for you ranks on your Brand SERP, then you either need to deal with it by pushing positive reviews as described below, or drown it using the techniques I explain in the leapfrogging lessons in this course.

So, make the choice - will you improve the result and make it welcome on your Brand SERP, or will you try to push it off your SERP?

If you decide to push it off your SERP, don‚Äôt touch it. Don‚Äôt update your profile, or encourage your clients to give reviews. If you hope to push it off your SERP, the less up-to-date it appears to be, the better. 

If you decide to make it look better either because it is important to you or because it is relevant to your audience, then include it in your overall review strategy, and make it priority number #1.

Review platform strategy
Rather than focus on the specifics of individual platforms, I think it is more helpful to look at how you can make your global review platform strategy effective - both client-facing and Google-facing. 

First, set out the battlefield
You're not going to be able to push your review scores up on every single platform - there are too many.

Find those you should concentrate on by searching for your brand name plus the word ‚Äúreviews‚Äù.
Make a list of all the review platforms that come up on the first two pages. Some will be the major players such as Trustpilot, Better Business Bureau, Yellow Pages or Glassdoor. Others will be specific to your market. You need both types.

Now, you have your list of perhaps a dozen platforms. Maybe more or less depending on your company and the industry. 
First thing is you need to claim and update the profiles. Some platforms allow you to control your profile, some don't, but claim all you can. 

For any that you are not going to be working on actively, once you have claimed them, do not update them. You don‚Äôt want them to look fresh to Google.

Optimize the others - provide as much information about your brand as possible and make sure all the information on your profile is accurate and up-to-date - the phone number, the description, the logo, and so on. Most importantly, your brand name needs to be exactly the same as it appears on your site. 

Now, pick your battles. 
Choose two or three from the list that have either have four stars already or that you can push relatively easily up to four stars. When you're making that choice, take into account these factors and choose those that strike the best balance for your business

1 - the current score -  the lower the score, the more you need to improve it, obviously
2 - the number of reviews on the platform already - the more there are, the harder it is to move the needle‚Ä¶ but also the more reviews there are, the stronger the signal to Google. There‚Äôs a balance there :)
3 - the authority of the review platform in Google‚Äôs eyes
4 - the authority of the review platform in your audience‚Äôs eyes
5 - the relevancy of the platform to your audience. If one exists, a niche platform that is popular with your audience is a better choice than the big hitters - relevancy can often outrank authority. Plus they are more likely to send qualified traffic that is easy to convert.
6 - ownership of the reviews. Look at whether THEY retain the ownership of your reviews. Getting tied in to a review platform is definitely not ideal, especially if there is a fee attached
7 - control. Be wary of platforms that limit your control of your profile
8 - cost. Look carefully at the short and long term cost. Promoting a paid platform might be sustainable short term, but not long term. Be careful about ongoing costs. 

Once you have your list of two or three platforms, push your clients as much as you can to them to get as many reviews as you can. If you get sufficient positive reviews on the two or three platforms that you've chosen (and you have chosen them wisely) then one - perhaps two - will hit page one and stay there. Other less-positive review platforms will drop off page one. 

Once that happens, not only does your Brand SERP look MUCH better to people searching your brand name, but you will have improved Google‚Äôs opinion of you. 

Now, the practicalities.

Asking for a review
Since people who are happy with your products and services are less likely to give a review than those who are unhappy, you HAVE to ask for reviews.
You can do this at several stages‚Ä¶
With website sales

On your site at the end of the checkout process. As long as the user experience on your site is amazing, this gives a great return of positive reviews.
In an immediate post-sale email
On their user account post purchase
On the support site
As part of a post-sales phone call
As an integral part of a later follow up email
As a dedicated email a few days or weeks after purchase
Offline sales
Face to face at time of sale
In a post-sale email - but obviously you need to get their email, which isn‚Äôt always practical
In a post-sales conversation

When asking immediately, you rely 100% on a great purchase experience. When asking later on, you rely on the client being 100% happy with the value your product has brought them.
You need to use your good judgement to decide which is best for your situation. 

As an offline business, you are probably used to asking for reviews person-to-person. As an online business, you may have lost sight of the fact that talking to people is surprisingly effective. The idea that saving on staff by minimising contact with clients is a good business move. It might be.
But it might be profitable for you to build direct contact with your clients into your review strategy. 

Using email to ask for reviews is the easy and the option that is currently most fashionable. Emails are very powerful. They are a cheap and easy way to encourage reviews. But they can also be VERY annoying. We have all become used to receiving multiple email follow ups when we make a purchase. Some are MUCH more annoying than others.

When planning your followup email strategy, think about your own experience as a client. We are all used to receiving multiple post-purchase emails‚Ä¶ When done well, they are actually helpful. When done badly, they kill any chance of getting a review - and could potentially lose the client. As a client we have all been subjected to ‚Äòbullying by email‚Äô. You hate it. I hate it. So do your clients. Don‚Äôt do it.

When you're asking for a review, be very careful about the wording. 
How you word the request has an enormous effect on both the content of the review and the rating. Asking directly for a positive rating or for specifics in the wording of a review will often have the opposite effect.

So try to guide them towards expressing explicitly that they're satisfied with your products and services - without asking directly.
Don‚Äôt ask direct questions about aspects of your product or service since they will tend to encourage simple yes and no answers that make no sense to the outside world. 

For example ‚ÄòDid our noise-reducing headphones live up to your expectations‚Äù might very well illicit a great rating, but a review that simple says ‚Äúyes‚Äù - and that makes no sense to anyone.

So when you phrase your request, bear in mind that people often simply continue your line of thought. That is a powerful insight.

Starting with ‚ÄúWe hope you were satisfied with XXXX‚Äù puts the word ‚Äúsatisfied‚Äù in their mind. With that phrasing, the review could easily start with ‚ÄúI was very satisfied with ‚Ä¶‚Äù

Or an open question encourages them to create context‚Ä¶
 ‚ÄúWhat was the best feature of the headphones?‚Äù encourages the client to describe their experience - ‚ÄúThe best feature...‚Äù or ‚ÄúI loved‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚ÄúThese headphones saved my life on a long flight‚Ä¶‚Äù

Importantly, be positive. Negative questions encourage negative replies. Positive questions and statements encourage positive replies.

You really want the overwhelming majority of reviews are super-positive.
At least 80%. If you are struggling there, you may want to filter who you reach out to and avoid reaching out to customers if you aren‚Äôt reasonably confident they will give a good review.
That is an option. 
But if you need to filter, do some soul searching...
1 - maybe your product isn‚Äôt as good as you think
2 - maybe your client service need an overhaul
3 - maybe the UX on your website isn‚Äôt good enough
4 - maybe you are attracting the wrong clients

If you DO filter, don't overdo it. 
Having only five star reviews over a period of time is a big red flag to Google that you're cheating. Filtering in this manner is against Google's guidelines. And excessive positivity is easy to spot for Google. 

From a business perspective, perhaps have a look at those you are filtering out - try to resolve them‚Ä¶ and THEN ask them for a review. That isn‚Äôt explicitly against Google‚Äôs guidelines.

And then, if less than 80% of your clients are super-satisfied with your products and your service, then you are fighting an uphill struggle you are likely to lose.

How to dialogue on the platform themselves
The important word here is dialogue. This is a conversation. Your clients are expressing their opinion.  

Reply to every review, positive, negative or middle-of-the-road. That is great for your relations with that existing client‚Ä¶ but also sends a very positive signal to prospects and  Google that you're looking after ALL your clients. 

So if they've given you a five or a four star review, reply, ‚Äúglad we're of service‚Äù, something friendly. 

One, Two or Three stars, respond to their complaint. Offer a solution. If they aren‚Äôt clear about quite what was wrong, ask them ‚ÄúWe are sorry you weren‚Äôt fully satisfied with XXXX. What could we have made your experience with us better‚Äù.  And take the dialogue off the platform until it is resolved.

Importantly, bear in mind, whatever the review score and content, your client took the time to give the review - the fact that they made that effort merits that you make the effort of replying properly. I‚Äôll go into more detail a little later.

Now, do this first for the platforms you've chosen to focus on. But over time, reply to every review, even on the platforms you aren't focusing on.

An additional tip - take this opportunity to push out to Google additional information you want to communicate about your brand and products. Google gets a lot of information about businesses and products from reviews. It has a patent that confirms this. 

A demonstration is that when I search for a coffee shop with free wifi, the result I am shown often shows a review that indicated ‚Äúgreat free wifi‚Äù.  So this is an opportunity to communicate specific attributes of your products such as color, or size, taste, presentation, geo-location, or the fact that you're open 24 hours a day, whatever it might be, you can actually add this into your replies, and Google will pick up on it. 

Warning ! Drip feed this information and be subtle. Keep it as natural as you can. Don't be heavy handed and make your replies a sales pitch. Reply to the review and stick to the topic of the original comment - add one tiny bit of information at a time. 

Handling individual less-than-4-star reviews
You might not agree with their rating, but when answering, show that you are open to a dialogue, and that you are looking to improve. Listen to them, be empathetic to what their problems are, and that you want to know what expectations you failed to fulfill.

Offer a dialogue 
First answer you give, make sure you offer to dialogue with them. 
But try to take the discussion off the review platform. There are multiple reasons for this - 
1- you reduce the risk that it goes horribly wrong and the texts attached to the review becomes even more damaging to you
2 - in a specific case like this, you run the risk of giving out private or sensitive information.
3 - review platforms are not designed for after sales service. I can‚Äôt imagine many people really want to read the entire case history of a specific client on a review platform. 

Whatever their problem, if they then reply on the platform or off, actually act on what they're saying. Solve their problem, make them happy, then put a concluding comment on the review when everything is resolved.

At that point, you might even ask them to change their rating and possibly their review. If they switch a 1 star rating to a five star rating, that's a very strong positive signal to Google - Google remembers the old 1 star rating and bad review... when that changes to 5 stars, it shows Google that you're taking care of your clients after the sale, even if they weren't initially happy that your business. It  clearly shows that your brand is committed to making every client you work with completely satisfied with your service or your product. 
And in my experience, this type of ‚Äúconverted client‚Äù is often the most vocal about your glory. 

If you feel an individual review or rating is unfair, you can try to get it removed
Drowning bad reviews is all well and good. But you need a heavy ratio in your favour. Having them removed is much, MUCH better.

On most platforms, you can ask for removal of individual reviews on a case by case basis.
And this is often more successful than you might think. 
Most review platforms will remove a bad review in these cases.
black hat
spam
bad language
excessive 
vindictive
the person is not a client
negative SEO against you, perhaps by a competitor. 

To make this happen, you need to be Sherlock Holmes. You need to become a detective. Investigate the review, build a solid case and prove to the platform that review is not positive for THEIR brand. In all the cases I listed, whether dishonest or fake or ruse‚Ä¶ the review is negative for THEIR their brand image. Out of pure self-interest, they will probably remove it.

Be self-aware.
If you've got a bad, bad review. Take a good, honest look at yourself. Be honest with yourself about your service or your product.
Improving your product or service is the best way to avoid fighting negative reviews in the future."
Explanation of employee reviews in the context of a brand SERP	"Quick word about employee reviews. 
Get them off your Brand SERP. It is very very rare that an employee review platform is positive for a company.
Employee review platforms and notoriously very volatile. Employee reviews are a very delicate question. And sites that collect reviews from employees are a ‚Äúno‚Äù for your exact match Brand SERP. 
In terms of improving them, individual cases are very, very specific, so there's little general advice I can usually give except perhaps to treat employees the way you would like to be treated as an employee."
Explanation of how to deal with negative third Party Blog Articles about your brand	"When A third party is ranking on your Brand SERP with an article that reflects badly on your brand. The blue link and description are unhelpful, inaccurate or outright negative. Or maybe they have given you a bad rating and the yellow star looks bad?

What can you do to deal with this problem? 

You have two choices.
1 - Drown it with better content, push it down the rankings‚Ä¶ off page 1, and out of sight
2 - Start a dialogue and try to get it changed

I recommend that you do both. 
Since you have no control over the content, if you want any change to the article, you‚Äôre going to have to ask them to change it‚Ä¶ and to do THAT you need to build a relationship and building a relationship takes time. 

So, ideally, you start a dialogue with them with the aim of convincing them to at least change what shows in your SERP. At the same time, you start a leapfrogger campaign to push the article down.

Why bother doing both? 
You could just drown it, and that moves it out of view for most of your audience. But people will still see the article in other contexts, and reducing its negative impact in every context is a good thing from a business point of view. 

And reducing negativity is also important from an SEO point of view. Google has ranked this content on your Brand SERP. It therefore thinks the content is pertinent. Google believes what this person is saying, and that damages the Trust part of your Expertise Authority  and Trust in Google‚Äôs eyes. If you can, get the author to soften their point of view, that sends a very positive E-A-T signal to Google.

Even better, the work you do on controlled and semi-controlled content such as your social media accounts, review sites, informational sites and so on will help your E-A-T, and that will help with your efforts to manage and improve your Brand SERP, and also your wider SEO strategy.

Now, a quick warning - actually getting someone who has written a scathing article or given a very bad review to change what they have written about your is tough. They don‚Äôt appreciate you or your products, and you are asking for a big turnaround. Worth a try, but doesn‚Äôt succeed very often. 
Importantly, don‚Äôt push it. If your initial attempts to connect with them and contact them don‚Äôt work, then you should stop because you could well make things worse and spark another negative article. Use your good judgement

If the article is simply unconvincing, they simply didn‚Äôt see the amazing benefits of your product. In that case, an enthusiastic presentation might just get some positive changes for you. 

If it is just the title and description that are uninspiring, then getting a change might prove pretty easy. They‚Äôll probably want to improve their appearance in the SERPs, both on your Brand SERP, but more importantly for them, on other SERPs where that article appears.

There are all sorts of different cases of suboptimal and negative third party content, and I can‚Äôt cover them all. This lesson is the description of an approach I‚Äôve found to be successful. You will need to adapt it to your specific case.  

Also, I suggest you watch the lesson about Improving the Results You do not Control in the Fundamentals course - the ideas and approach here are quite similar to that, so both will be useful and give you ideas about how to approach your particular problem.

Starting a relationship is absolutely essential
The best way to start this relationship is through a mutual acquaintance. Look at your list of contacts and see if you know someone in common - LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook all allow you to see connections or followers you have in common. That‚Äôs a great way to start.

If you do both know someone, and you know them well enough, then ask for an introduction from that person - the entire task usually becomes MUCH simpler, as you can imagine.

If you can‚Äôt get the introduction, then try to connect with them on social media - LinkedIn, Twitter or Facebook. Connect on one or two platforms to be sure you get your name on their horizon.

They wrote an article about your brand or product. Like you, they probably haven‚Äôt thought much about the people behind it. You are showing them a name and a face of a person - and that may start to change their attitude to the brand.

If they connect, then you can start a dialogue.
If they don‚Äôt connect or react, don‚Äôt necessarily give up. They might just be busy and have missed your connection request. You might well want to move onto the next step anyway - but be wary, and be tactful. If the article is VERY critical, you could well make things worse and spark another negative article. In that case, just stick to leapfrogging. Use your good judgement

Once they have seen you, message them, or send an email if you have their address‚Ä¶ and start building that relationship.

But don‚Äôt rush it. This isn‚Äôt like linkbuilding where you might shoot off emails to 30 people and hope that a couple reply. There is only one person here. And that person is sitting on your Brand SERP. And they are the only person that can help you. If you rush in and get it wrong, the game is over. 

Don‚Äôt approach this from the point of view of asking for what YOU want - stop and think about how they feel, what they're looking for. Put yourself in their shoes and try to see what value you can bring to THEM. 

Clearly, if you start the dialogue with ‚ÄúI me mine‚Äù, then you have almost zero chance.

Start the dialogue with some demonstrable benefit to them, and you have a chance of getting to a point where you can ask for changes. This is not easy to do. It requires empathy and tact.

Here are some ideas for value you can bring them.
If they misunderstood the functionality or if you updated your product since the article was written, then accuracy is a possible angle. They will want to be accurate and honest with their audience. 

If the metas are uninspiring, then improving their presence in the SERPs is a good angle.

If the article is good, but uninspiring, you could approach this with the idea that you are building a page linking to articles about your brand or product, and their article could be included in that page. That may inspire them to do a rewrite.

If the article is clearly inaccurate,then tactfully pointing them to a resource about E-A-T might work - inaccurate information in an article attached to their name will damage the Expertise element of their Expertise Authority and Trust.

If you know SEO, then helping them with the SEO of that page might be a quid pro quo that could interest them. Stating it that blatantly is probably a bad idea, but offering some advice might work - indicating other keywords they could potentially rank for, or a featured snippet they might be able to win.

Those are all ideas for approaches that bring value to them. You‚Äôll need to look at the specific case, and adapt.

Practically speaking you priority is the metas
You could get them to change the meta title. They could correct an inaccuracy, or tone it down and maybe even a little positive about you. A better meta title is an opportunity for them to look better on the SERP, and also to rank slightly better for existing keywords, or rank for more keywords‚Ä¶ and that gives them more visibility and potentially more traffic. 

Same thing for the meta-description. Once again, perhaps they can make it more accurate, or perhaps they can tone it down. 

You might want to ask them to change the content. But bear in mind that's very delicate - you‚Äôd need a good relationship AND a very good reason. Telling people what to say on their site is obviously a delicate issue... 

Good reasons include 
- if they've got something factually incorrect  
- if you‚Äôve updated your product 
- if your brand has changed in some way - logo, location, market, or perhaps been bought by a large corporation
- if the article has enormous potential to rank for some great keywords with just a little SEO work (that you can help with)

Throughout any exchanges you have with them, don‚Äôt lose sight of the fact that this specific issue isn‚Äôt a priority for them. It‚Äôs super important for you, but probably right at the bottom of their list of priorities. Once again, look at it from that point of view. Put yourself in their shoes and try to see how you can make it a higher priority for them.

All of that assumes you have managed to build a positive relationship with the person. 
 If you can't build the relationship or the relationship doesn't allow you to ask for those changes. Don‚Äôt push your luck. Stop. If you feel that they‚Äôre not going to be helpful, don't push them.

Also, don‚Äôt bully or argue - that will almost certainly make them angry, and could well explode in your face - you could well make things worse and spark a rewrite that‚Äôs even MORE negative.

And don‚Äôt call the lawyers or take an argument onto a public platform - watch the lesson about Tactics to Avoid and Mistakes not to Make in the fundamentals course if you haven‚Äôt already. 

If you have watched it, I can simply say ‚ÄúThe Streisand Effect‚Äù, and you‚Äôll know what I mean :)

This is the point where you‚Äôll be glad you started leapfrogging before you contacted them. Their article will probably already be falling down the rankings on your Brand SERP, and may soon drop onto page #2 :)

Making the most of a bad situation
If this person said something negative, unless it is out of pure spite, there's probably a reason behind it. You could be a little bit self-aware and see where you are falling short and  what you can do to improve. 

You can also learn something by asking yourself why they're ranking for your brand. What are they doing right that allows them to rank for YOUR name above content that you think is better? 

Something about their SEO has convinced Google their article is a relevant and helpful resource for YOUR audience. So reverse engineer the SEO of that article - wording, inbound links, trust signals, structured data and so on‚Ä¶ figure out what that article has that the articles below it don‚Äôt, and get some handy tips and tricks that will help you with your Brand SERP SEO."
Explanation of Leapfrogging in the Context of Removing Negative Results on Your Brand SERP	"When You have a negative or imperfect result on page one that you haven't managed to improve or feel is too difficult to improve.
Here‚Äôs a couple of examples. 

You've tried contacting them, talking to them, seeing their point of view, giving them convincing arguments as to why they really SHOULD change or remove the content. You've maybe even tried giving them a gift.

They just won't listen.
And you want perfection on your Brand SERP - You want to make it so that what people see on page #1 when they Google your name is one hundred percent representative, one hundred percent accurate and one hundred percent positive. We're going to use a technique called leapfrogging to drown this sub-optimal content. This is better than trying to drown by creating lots of spammy content. Hopefully you have watched the lesson the the fundamentals course covering why that is such a bad idea.

What is ‚ÄòLeapfrogging‚Äô in Brand SERPs?
It is simply pushing one piece of content above another and thus pushing the other one down one position. Pushing a less-good or a bad result down means it‚Äôs less prominent, less visible and less credible in the eyes of the user. And, if you can leapfrog that lower quality content with enough better quality content, you can push it down to page #2, and it becomes invisible to most users.

The trick to removing imperfect and negative content from your SERP  is to find candidate content that you can help to rank and find enough candidates to push all the negative and imperfect content off page #1 - replacing it with positive, accurate and relevant content YOU choose.  

Remember that Google wants your Brand SERP to reflect fairly on you. So if your brand really IS as great as you think it is, then there is no reason for Google to show anything other than great content on your Brand SERP!

In this lesson, I‚Äôll use the terms ‚Äúleapfrogger‚Äù for the quality content that you‚Äôre optimising and trying to push up. And ‚Äúleapfroggee‚Äù for the negative content you are trying to push down.

Throughout this, bear in mind that the best leapfrogger candidates will be those that bring the most value to Google‚Äôs users searching on your brand name. 
These people are looking for you specifically, either researching you or navigating to your site. These people are Google‚Äôs users, and Google is trying to give them an honest, balanced view of your brand.
The content it shows needs to bring value to the user. That means iit needs to be representative and relevancy. That is Google‚Äôs focus. That means you must also focus there. Look for content that is representative of your brand and is relevant to someone researching you - make sure there is VALUE for Google‚Äôs users. What you prefer is secondary.

Now. Leapfrogging on Brand SERPs in a nutshell
In order to leapfrog content, you need to convince Google that the leapfrogger content is more relevant and brings more value to its user than the leapfrogee. Simple :)"
Choosing Whether to Try to Control 100% of Your Brand SERP	"Before starting, there is an important consideration. 
Do you want to try to control ALL of your Brand SERP, or do you want to have some third party content there. 

If you can push out third party content you have no control over, and your Brand SERP contains ONLY content you have control or partial control over, then you have more control over what users see when they Google you. And control means safety and peace of mind. 

Leaving third party content on your Brand SERP is positive in that independent content that sings your praises is a very positive signal to your audience. It has the danger that you have no control, and if that content changes for the worse, because you have actively promoted it to push it onto your SERP, it will be difficult to remove. At the end of this lesson I will give you some typical examples of the type of third party content you want to avoid using for leapfrogging. In the other leapfrogging lessons, I‚Äôll flag more specific third party content that is dangerous from this perspective."
How to Identify Leapfrogger Content in the Context of Brand SERPs	"Firstly, make a list of leapfrogger candidates
If you have done the first lesson in the fundamentals course, then you will already have a list of the results that appear on your Brand SERP on desktop, on mobile and perhaps across multiple countries. 
If you haven‚Äôt, then the screencast that shows you how to do that is in the supplementary material of this lesson. Please watch that now. 
Now, for leapfrogger content, you might need to look deeper. So look at pages 3 through 6 in the same way you did pages 1 and 2, and you should have about 60 to 70 results. 

Don‚Äôt worry about pushing content up from 5th or 6th page. Pushing content up from that low down is pretty easy‚Ä¶ up to page 2; THEN it gets tough. You‚Äôll find that the first leap from pages 3 to 6 up to page 2 usually goes pretty smoothly. If it doesn‚Äôt 

So now you have a big list of all the content on the first few pages.
Now, make a ‚Äòleapfrogger list‚Äô of all the content that ranks below the leapfroggee and order your leapfrogger content according to these seven factors

1- how relevant and valuable it is to your audience (this is the primary consideration)

2 - how high it already ranks (higher is better since it has less far to rise)

3 - whether the page brings something additional to the table for your audience that isn‚Äôt already available on page #1 of your Brand SERP (in particular, avoid content that repeats anything in your sitelinks - that is a bad candidate)

4 - whether the meta title and description are actively positive (you want positive results on your SERP, not just neutral)

5 - Whether your audience trusts the publisher (having a trusted  independent third party singing your praises on your SERP is a  BIG plus for you) 

6 - whether the domain is powerful (this makes it easier to rank the content)

7 - the level of control you have (do you want total control or leave some  impartiality?)

You then choose the top candidates and get to work pushing them up the SERP. 

How many do you need? 
Well, enough leapfrogger content to push the leapfrogee content down off page one‚Ä¶ but choose more than you need so that if the first choice won't rank for whatever reason, you have another couple of fallbacks that you're also working on. 

If the leapfrogee content is right at the bottom of page #1, you need at least three leapfrogger candidates to work on. If it's second from the bottom of the page, you need at least four candidates to work on... and so on. 

This lesson is an overview to identify candidates‚Ä¶ For a more detailed explanation and to learn ‚Äòwhat to DO, please watch the other lessons on how to leapfrog with different types of content.

And a quick note on the lower ranking pages. If you choose a page that ranks below page 2, if it doesn‚Äôt hit page 2 after you have done some good optimisation work, you might want to consider leaving it and choosing another. Typically, if there isn‚Äôt an initial leap, then that page will probably never make it onto page 1. 

Now, choosing the leapfrogger content.

Opportunities you control. 
Leapfrogger content on your own site is great, and very tempting to choose since you have control‚Ä¶ But it has the disadvantage that Google wants variety of sources on the SERP, so it will tend to avoid ranking multiple results from one site. 

Another of your sites that ISN‚ÄôT your main domain is a often a better candidate. You need to get the teams who run them to see the bigger picture and work with you. 

Next, opportunities you partially control. 

Social accounts are very good candidates - they rank very easily because they're naturally very pertinent for your audience. The 4 major platforms that rank most easily are: YouTube, Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter‚Ä¶
but other platforms can be pertinent and powerful, depending on your audience. 

The key to pushing this type of leapfrogger content is sustained activity on the account‚Ä¶ with a special emphasis on engagement from your audience. Importantly, don‚Äôt post content only about yourself, sure‚Ä¶ add content on relevant topics from other sources. Make sure the content you are sharing is interesting and useful for your audience. Try to get images and videos into the mix - that will help with engagement, but also getting video and  image bowes in your Brand SERP.

Partner sites are a great option because you have a relationship with them already. You can talk to them directly, and they have a good reason to help you. 

If you have an app, then app platforms rank easily. They are very relevant and useful to your audience. And the platforms have powerful sites. Just make sure that you have lots of reviews, and that they are overwhelmingly positive. 

Review platforms with 4 stars or more. These bring perhaps less value to your audience than an app or a social account, but still it's a great candidate. For specifics - watch the review platforms lesson.

For both any content that collects reviews and displays the aggregate score, you only want to push those that have lots of reviews‚Ä¶ 
if you have only a handful, the review score the great-looking result can ‚Äòflip‚Äô quite easily and become negative for you. For example, if you have only 3 reviews, then just one 1 star review will send your average score down a LONG way‚Ä¶ it will show 3 stars on your Brand SERP. And that looks bad. 

Next, opportunities where you have no control. 

There are a vast range of possibilities here. The types of content that make good leapfrogger candidates depends on many, many factors including your industry, your brand, geo-location, the language‚Ä¶ 
Bear in mind that you are looking for content that is relevant, is valuable to your audience, is positive about your brand, is from a publisher your audience trusts, and (importantly) not volatile and likely to ‚Äòflip‚Äô on you.

A 4 or 5 star journalist review is a great candidate. 
It's a double opportunity. 
Not only can you improve your Brand SERP with an independent review from a respected journalist‚Ä¶ but you can start or improve your relationship with the publisher or the journalist‚Ä¶ and that can be great for future content opportunities and collaboration. 

Any positive article from a blogger or journalist is also a double opportunity in the same way.

Why such a short section on third party content?
Because the variety is so vast and also because I tend to play safety first and aim mostly for leapfrogger content that I control or partially control. Prioritising those gives me control of the SERP, and that brings me security and peace of mind. 

That isn‚Äôt an absolute rule, of course. Great content from third parties your audience trusts can bring a lot to the table. 

Here's some content you should not use as a leapfrogger. 

Don't push third party comparison pages. 
They can ‚Äòflip‚Äô. Offers change, opinions change, competitors offer gifts... If it flips, you have no control and it will be tough to beat (since you will have made it VERY strong :) 

Don't push forums. 
Once they're up there, they're one of the toughest types of content to push down your Brand SERP. They are very ‚Äòsticky‚Äô because they are fresh and relevant to your audience - that‚Äôs two good reasons for Google to like them. 
If you use a forum post as leapfrogger content, you create a potential monster - it can flip, and since you don‚Äôt control it, you will have created a really thorny problem for yourself. 
As a general rule, forum threads that rank on Brand SERPs are very, VERY hard to drown.

Don't push negative-positive copywriting. 
An example of this is "Getting Round Spam Blacklists Isn't so Hard with PoppyMailer". 
It's tempting to push a great piece of content, despite the positive-negative meta title or description because you see that it‚Äôs good content underneath. But any  negative words in your Brand SERP damage your brand image. A negative word on your Brand SERP plants a seed of doubt.
So negative words in the metas are a ‚Äòno‚Äô, even if the content is positive. Unless you can get the publisher to change the metas.

Review platform with few reviews 
Review platforms are great candidates. IF they have over 4 out of 5 stars AND a lot of reviews. If they show a low rating, obviously you don't want them on your Brand SERP. But you don't want them on your Brand SERP if they don't have many reviews. When you have few reviews, any one new review can change the score dramatically. 
For example, if you have a 2 reviews that give a 4 star rating, and one person gives you a 1 star review, your rating drops to 3 out of 5 and you suddenly look bad. 

Employee review platforms
Using these as leapfrogger content is a very, very bad idea. They very rarely have good scores on them. And even if you have one that does, they have low numbers of reviews, so they are volatile. Plus employee reviews are very delicate to manage, whether ex-employees or current employees‚Ä¶ 
All of that makes employee review platforms very dangerous ground.

Now you have enough information to make informed decisions about the candidate leapfrogger content and make a prioritised list of results you will work on.

BUT, before making your final list, have a think about rich elements. 
You might want to replace one of your list of candidates with a strategy to trigger a rich element - relatively easy candidates here include sitelinks, video boxes and image boxes. 
Obtaining these doesn‚Äôt seem like leapfrogging, but it is‚Ä¶ kind of :) 
They appear from nowhere - ie you created a result in your SERP that didn‚Äôt exist before. So not technically leapfrogging, but it has the same effect.
And they have an additional advantage - they take TWO spots on the Brand SERP - they kill a blue link... that‚Äôs DOUBLE drowning. How cool is that ?

So, rich elements are doubly effective for leapfrogging - they replace a blue link, they reduce the number of blue links on your SERP. 

And beyond those two great wins... better still, the work you do to get them will improve your content strategy.... AND they‚Äôll make your Brand SERP more multimedia, and THAT that makes you look more credible to your audience.

Here are two of the easiest to trigger. 
Sitelinks are content you control directly because they come from your own site... they aren‚Äôt difficult to get, and they often kill a blue link.

Video boxes look great and probably aren't going to be difficult to trigger. They also usually kill a blue link. If you see ANY videos in your leapfrogger candidates list (even from third parties) that's a sign that Google is almost ready to give you the video boxes. It just needs a friendly nudge - either some nice fresh video content, or extra engagement on the existing content. Or both. 

Make that list, then watch the relevant episodes, either in this course or in the Rich Elements course to learn what to actually DO."
Explanation of How to Leapfrog Using Content You COntrol in. the Context of Negative Results on Your Brand SERP	"There's a bad result you want to leapfrog with content you published that is more positive for your brand.

In your list of leapfrogger content to work on, there is a page you control. What can you do to push YOUR content up your Brand SERP, leapfrog the negative content and push that down the SERP? 

Content you own is great on page #1 of your Brand SERP since you are the source, it‚Äôs on your site, you control it‚Ä¶ but it also brings multiple wins. It will rank on your Brand SERP and make your Brand SERP look better. But, since you are improving the SEO on your content, you are also improving ir for all other keywords. It will rank better for those, and maybe even some more, and that widen your reach, improve your visibility and give you some additional organic traffic.

However, as I mentioned in the previous lesson, content on your own site brings a big disadvantage

Two results from one site is not generally what Google wants. Google has specifically said so, and even released updates aimed at reducing the number of SERPs with multiple results from the same site.

Your homepage is a given. 
That is one result from your site right at the top. So, leapfrogger content that resides on your site needs to bring additional information - information that the homepage doesn‚Äôt bring. If Google is to put that content on your Brand SERP, it needs to bring extra special value to the user. It can be done. And if you can do it, it's a big win since you then have control over two elements on your brand's SERP.  

The easier candidates are those on other sites you own. These are often very easy wins. Because the two websites are different entities, Google won‚Äôt consider them as being another result from your main brand site‚Ä¶ plus, they are very relevant for your audience, bringing valuable related information.  

For example, Disney has multiple sites for its different companies, assets, departments and so on. Multiple Disney sites rank on Disney's Brand SERP. So leverage content on other sites your brand owns and runs‚Ä¶ that are about your brand, of course. 

It almost certainly isn‚Äôt a good idea to move your blog or client system to a seperate domain JUST to get an additional result you control on page #1 of your Brand SERP. The cost is very likely to outweigh the benefits.

It certainly isn‚Äôt a good idea to create a spammy blog with thin content.  It almost certainly won‚Äôt rank, and even if it does, it will reflect badly on your brand in the eyes of your users.

Quick note on subdomains. They are part of your main site and so will tend to appear in sitelinks and are not generally good candidates for leapfrogging. There are exceptions, but don‚Äôt bet on yours being an exception.

I‚Äôll use the terms ‚Äúleapfrogger‚Äù for your quality content that you are optimising and trying to push up. And ‚Äúleapfroggee‚Äù for the negative content you are trying to push down.

So, how do you leapfrog with your own content?
Remember content that appears on page #1 of your SERP is the content that Google considers most relevant and brings most value to people searching your brand name.  In order to leapfrog, you need to convince Google that the leapfrogger content is more relevant and brings more value to that user.

Doing SEO 
All of this applies whether the content is on your main site or another site you control directly. If it isn‚Äôt on your main site, you might need to liaise with the people who run the site and help them implement the changes. If that is the case, help them by preparing the work for them as far as is possible, reasonable and tactful. 

First, onpage
To push this leapfrogger content up, you want to do all the typical things that you would do for SEO. 
If you haven‚Äôt watched the SEO episode in the foundation course, then please do so. The techniques in that episode will be super useful.

Here are the relatively easy wins - if you know SEO, don‚Äôt hold back from using your own optimisations.

When working on the SEO for your content remember that there are page and block level considerations. At page level, you need to make sure it's really fast and make sure it is truly mobile friendly.

The aim is to make sure that Googlebot, which crawls your site using a mobile, understands that the user experience on mobile is great for this page. 

Use these tools to see how Google perceives your pagespeed and mobile friendliness. This is the metric you need to use. It doesn‚Äôt matter what you think about your own pagespeed and mobile-readiness. Google‚Äôs making the rules, so Google‚Äôs decision is final, as it were.

And other tools aren‚Äôt the metric either. Use them to help you improve, of course. But the last word goes to Google‚Äôs tools.

You want to add schema.org markup. The type of Schema markup depends on the type of page. Add WebPage type if that is applicable.

Then look further and see if more markup is appropriate. Examples would be product, service, collection, series, place, person, event‚Ä¶ You need to identify what markup will best help Google understand and digest the leapfrogger content that you are trying to promote. And don‚Äôt be lazy and think your can skip this - you can always write at least SOME schema on any type of content. Just find the most appropriate type for the leapfrogger  content.

Adding schema markup in particular will help your content perform in other areas of your wider SEO strategy, especially winning a place in rich √©l√©ments, so this step really is worth spending the time to do it right. 

If appropriate, you can put some of the content in HTML tables or lists. This gives the content more structure more and that makes it much easier for Google to digest and understand, which helps your SEO for that content. Don‚Äôt put things is HTML table or lists if it is not appropriate to do so. That actually has the opposite effect. 

Improve your linking. Add multiple links in your site main site and other owned sites to point to this content. Make sure the links are from relevant, related content. You might want to think about linking to it from the main copy of your homepage. That sends a strong signal to Google that this content is important. 
By the way, a link in the footer is the easy, lazy option but is very unlikely to have any effect.

 If the site isn‚Äôt your main site, make sure you also add links to relevant content on the main site so that Google clearly sees the relationship.

Add some multimedia - images or video. Google is super-keen on video especially. And make sure any multimedia files you add are optimised - 
Images - appropriate filename, small filesize, alt tag, caption, and using the <figure> HTML tag
Video - appropriate filename, small filesize, caption, using the <figure> HTML tag and a bespoke thumbnail.

I strongly advise looking at video. It will help the content rank and, as long as it is relevant, useful and interesting for your audience, it will also engage your audience, and help move your content strategy forwards. 

Look at the meta title and H1. If you want this content to rank for your brand name, then that must appear prominently in the meta title and the H1. Make sure the brand name is at the start of the meta title - if it is at the end, it will look like it has just been tagged onto the end. And it probably has :) 

Add user generated content if appropriate. Include user comments or reviews. they send a very strong signal to Google that this content is interest to your audience, which is especially important for ranking on Brand SERPs.

Give your users opportunities to contribute - perhaps reviews or comments. As long as these are legitimate and positive, that‚Äôs user generated content and that is powerful in SEO. UGC is especially in the context of SEO for your Brand SERP because it indicates high engagement from the target audience and that indicates clearly that the content is relevant and valuable to people searching your brand name. If people add comments or reviews regularly, then it also keeps the content fresh, which is good for Google.

Simplify your writing style. Tweak the content to make it simpler to consume. Keep sentences reasonably short, keep sentence structure simple, avoid ambiguity, avoid colloquialisms - that is great for Google, but also great for the user. And when you are doing that, add relevant entities, words of co-occurrence and make sure you have created a context cloud that is highly focussed and relevant to your brand. 

Avoid ‚ÄòI me mine‚Äô as far as possible. This doesn‚Äôt help SEO directly, but it will help the page stay on page #1 when it gets there.

So, minimise use of the first person in your texts about yourself. The page is about you, and you are the star of your own film, as it were‚Ä¶ but we are all the stars of our own films, and content that does not address the reader and the reader‚Äôs needs is rarely engaging. Too many sentences that contain I, we, us, our is very off-putting. And most sentences that start ‚ÄúWe have blah blah‚Ä¶‚Äù can be rephrased to address either the user ‚ÄúYou can see blah blah‚Ä¶‚Äù or the user‚Äôs needs ‚ÄúBricklayers the world over blah blah blah‚Ä¶‚Äù.

You‚Äôll probably be surprised both at how much you use ‚ÄòI, me mine‚Äô, and also how well a text that keeps references to the first person to a minimum is more pleasant to read, even for you :) 

In all these content related tasks, be super-self-critical. Take a step back and look at what you are writing from the user‚Äôs point of view. 

Google appreciates fresh content, and it sees you have updated the page‚Ä¶ that will tend to push the result content higher up the Brand SERP. 
Show the last updated date on the page if that is reasonable - ie if it is an article or a product or similar‚Ä¶. Obviously not if it is a homepage. But for any type of page, make sure you have the WebPage schema markup and that the markup include the last modified attribute.

Next, off page

Get links to the leapfrogger content.
Here are a selection linkbuilding suggestions - by no means complete since there are so many ways to approach linkbuilding. If you are a linkbuilding guru, don‚Äôt hold back from using your own tactics. Just make sure they are white hat - watch the ‚ÄúTactics to Avoid and Mistakes not to Make‚Äù in the foundation course if you are still tempted to use link farms and PBNs.

Broken link opportunities. 
At its simplest, this technique is finding broken links to other, very similar content, contacting the website and suggesting the leapfrogger page as a good replacement.
Platforms such as SEMrush, Majestic or aHrefs have great tools to help you do this. 

Additional resource opportunities
Find relevant articles, then reach out to the author and suggest the leapfrogger content as a good a good candidate as an additional resource for article they have written. With a link, of course. Make sure the link would truly be a useful resource to their readers, who should also be your audience, by the way.

Add links to relevant business knowledge bases such as Crunchbase and generalist knowledge bases such as Wikidata. Pushing that further, you could add links to specialist, niche knowledge bases such as IMDB if the leapfrogger content is about films, or the registry of American dentists, if the leapfrogger content is relevant to dentistry. Search on Google to see which ones it trusts. Rich results like this indicate clearly Google trusts these directories, so they are great candidates.

Don‚Äôt be tempted to add links to low quality or irrelevant directories - that will do more harm than good.  

Overall, pay attention to detail.
One small thing can tip the balance in your favour and push that page up. Be patient and persevere. If the first thing you do doesn't work. Keep making those small improvements one by one. They all add up, little by little and bit by bit. 

But even if you fail to get that leapfrogger content up onto page #1, all is not lost. 

You haven‚Äôt wasted your time and resources, there are wins for you on the optimisation you have done.

If the page is on your main site, it will become a candidate for rich sitelinks. So even if it doesn't come up onto page one, it could very well appear in the sitelinks. Quality, well optimised content on your site is always going to be a strong candidate for rich sitelinks. 
And the better the content in the rich sitelinks, the better your brand looks to people searching for it. and make your brand look better. Especially when you consider how much real estate they cover and how much information they convey.
Watch the sitelinks lesson in the fundamentals course for more on those.

The other bonus is that the page will almost certainly rise in the rankings for other search terms. And that means you expand your audience, get more visibility for your brand in Google,  and more traffic. Great.

If the page is on another site you own, then, you have improved the chances of that page ranking on other SERPs, which is always a good thing. And you might also have brought some valuable knowledge to other members of your team."
Explanation of How to Leapfrog Using Content You Partially Control in. the Context of Negative Results on Your Brand SERP	"There's a bad result you want to leapfrog with content you published that is more positive for your brand.

In your list of leapfrogger content to work on, there is a page you partially control. What can you do to push that content up your Brand SERP, leapfrog the negative content and push that down the SERP? 

Results you partially control are great for leapfrogging. Some techniques you learned for content you control will be useful, but many techniques are different, so keep watching. 

Social media
Here, it's all about activity and engagement. Typical candidates are Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn - these will rank relatively easily because they are the big players in the space. Other platforms can rank, even smaller ones if they are super relevant to your audience. 

Whichever one is in your leapfrogger list, the key to pushing social media up the SERP is sustained activity on the account‚Ä¶ with a special emphasis on engagement from your audience. And the great bonus here is that this can easily tie into your wider content strategy, as we‚Äôll see later.

One major factor that people often forget is not to talk ONLY about themselves. If you do that, it is highly unlikely you will get good engagement from your audience. They will engage with content that brings value to THEM. And you cannot do that 24/7 with just content about you. They really aren‚Äôt interested in your 24/7.

For content you post, a good rule of thumb is three thirds - one third content you produce, one third content from third parties that your audience will find valuable, and one third just for fun.

Make sure ALL the content you are sharing is interesting and useful for your audience - valuable content triggers their engagement, and that is what we are looking for here. 

Also, try to get images and videos into the mix as much as possible - that will help with engagement, help rank these social profiles higher ‚Ä¶ 
And also help getting rich elements such as video boxes, image boxes and Twitter boxes in your Brand SERP. 

If you don‚Äôt have many images, use the resources the platform provides - animated GIFs, emojis and so on. 
If creating video seems too ambitious for your time and budget, have a look at videos your company has already produced, and see if you can make a few short clips from them. 
You can also look at stock videos - there are a lot of sites out there offering a vast choice of very good quality video. This is a cheap, simple option that looks very professional.
There are a lot of free video editing software options, and most of them are very intuitive to use‚Ä¶ so don‚Äôt let the editing part hold you back.

The rule of thirds also applies to links. Only one post in three should have a link. This is because the social platforms tend to give less visibility to content with external links, and push content from accounts that have a good record of engagement. Hopefully you see the trick - if you post external links, you don‚Äôt get as much visibility, and with less visibility, you get less engagement. And vice versa. Less links means the algorithms will give you more visibility and, assuming the content is quality and relevant and attractive,  that will tend to get engagement, which will help the next post more natural visibility.

Make sure you use hashtags - that helps widen your audience, and generate relevant engagement - and also tag in people and brands you cite or who will be interested by what you are saying.

And active, engaging and balanced social profile will create community, and community will push that profile up your Brand SERP. Having a community on social will also help your business.

If you have use Medium, that can also be a great candidate. 
Medium ranks very quickly and very easily if you write regularly, and can create an audience.

With all these, you are forced to think about, and create content. Don‚Äôt do that in isolation, look at how you can integrate this content into your wider content strategy - blog writing, video making, podcast recording, and so on. Or vice versa, see what content you are creating for your site that you can repurpose for social. Short clips from your videos, quotes from articles as text or in the form of images, soundbites from your podcast - there are lots of options :)

Review platforms
Some review platforms will be easier to push up because they are authoritative - Trustpilot, Better Business Bureau, Yellow Pages are good examples -  and others because they are niche - BrightLocal have a great list of those, and some because they are ‚Äòtrusted‚Äô. For this last group, what I mean is that some platforms have a partnership with Google for the Google Ads side of the SERP. Although that shouldn‚Äôt affect ranking, this list is a good indication of whom Google ‚Äòtrusts‚Äô. 

Any of these will be easier to rank that an ‚Äòoutlier‚Äô review platform. But, if your leapfrogger platform doesn‚Äôt come from one of my list - authoritative, relevant niche or trusted - that doesn‚Äôt mean you cannot push it up the SERP. Just be aware that it might be more difficult.

The trick to leapfrogging with these is fourfold
1 - updating the profile page on the platform - optimise every piece of information they allow you to edit. Address, description, title, images, links to your homepage or customer support page and so on.
2 - get lots of positive reviews. The more you get, the stronger the signal to Google.
3 - reply to every review, good or bad
4 - add the rating with a link to the platform on your site. Perhaps in the header if you think your audience will be impressed, or in the footer, or on a dedicated page

Do all that, and the platform will almost certainly push up the rankings on your Brand SERP, possibly quite quickly - say a couple of weeks. 

Like social platforms, you can very usefully make this part of a wider business strategy - the activity of encouraging more reviews and interacting with your customers publicly will help your wider SEO strategy, build trust in your audience, and increase your reach.

A word of warning - if the platform doesn‚Äôt have many reviews, or has a low rating, don‚Äôt use it as a leapfrogger unless you are SURE you can get lots and lots of positive reviews. A review platform with a low volume of ratings will be volatile and can easily flip on you. For example, if you have a fours start rating, but only 3 reviews, then just a single 1 star review will send your average score down a LONG way‚Ä¶ it will show 3 stars on your Brand SERP. And that looks bad. 
There‚Äôs a whole lesson about review platforms.

App platforms
If you have an App, then you might have an app platform ranking. iTunes, Google Play and other app platforms are very relevant and useful to your audience, and these are powerful sites. Just make sure your App description is accurate and relevant‚Ä¶ then, like the review platforms, encourage your users to give positive reviews. The volume of reviews will push your app page up the SERP. 

Industry specific websites and directories
Profile and directory listing pages from legitimate niche industry sites are great because they are highly relevant. If the platform is either popular with your target audience or has authority within your industry, Google will perceive it as useful and valuable to people searching your brand name.

Here, you need to 
1 - claim and update the profile page on the platform - optimise every piece of information they allow you to edit. Address, description, title, images, links to your homepage or customer support page and so on.
2 - if the platform allows it generate audience engagement, perhaps with ratings, or comments
3 - link to it from somewhere appropriate on your site

For this type of site, you might consider creating leapfroggers
Look on your direct competitors' Brand SERPs and see which industry-specific informational sites appear for them. Use you common sense and good judgement and create profiles on those that are TRULY relevant to your industry and audience. 

Guest articles
If you have an article you wrote for another platform that is a leapfrogger candidate, then do some content SEO on the article to push it up. Watch the SEO strategies lesson in the fundamentals course for more on that.

Pay particular attention to the metas and the heading - if you want it to rank for your brand name, you need to make your brand as much the focus as is reasonable. If the platform allows it, genuine user activity on the article such as ratings, comments and shares are a great way to push your article up the rankings, so encourage your audience to contribute. 

Profile pages on sites you guest blog for 
This is more likely to be a candidate than a specific article. To leapfrog with these, you need to optimise the profile page - title, description, images, biography, outbound links and so on... and also contribute more. Writing around your subject on that platform as a guest writer is s strong signal to Google that the site, and more specifically the profile page, is relevant and important to your brand. 

Informational sites 
Could be any site that provides factual information about brands - I frequently see generalist sites such as Wikipedia, Wikidata, Crunchbase, but there are lots of others, depending on your industry. 

With Wikipedia, if you have a page, this will rank page one very easily and is probably very near the top already. You can push it a little further by editing it.
The rules 
1 - Don‚Äôt make it obvious you work for the brand - either do it anonymously or, better still, through an account that has already contributed. Don‚Äôt use paid services - they are unlikely to be any better than doing it yourself.
2 - Only edit it once - prepare the texts carefully beforehand and make sure you get it right first time
3 - Change Only the first two sentence - small tweaks are less likely to attract attention
4 - stick to the facts - those first two sentences should focus on your brand, and a factual global overview of what you do. Nothing more. Pay particular attention to the way you write it.
Make sure you are 100% neutral. Don‚Äôt write anything that could possibly be construed as biased, advertising or bigging yourself up.
So, avoid adjectives as far as possible and particularly words like ‚Äúleading‚Äù, ‚Äúbest‚Äù, ‚Äúinnovative‚Äù, ‚Äúgreat‚Äù and so on - that means avoid any words that are associated with a point of view, rather than a fact. Biased wording is a BIG red flag for editors. 

And Wikipedia have bots that crawl updates and additions. These machines analyse the changes, and automatically inform editors of anything suspicious. So don‚Äôt think your tiny change will not be noticed because there are so many changes every day on Wikipedia. If there is ANYTHING suspicious, it will get flagged and brought to the attention of human editors, who will not hesitate to hit you hard for self-promotion - they hate self-promotion. 

If Wikipedia editors pick up on you, then they will add a big warning to the page, or worse, tag the article for deletion. So be very, very cautious. If you aren‚Äôt sure of what you are doing, don‚Äôt take the risk. Find another Leapfrogger candidate instead.
 I get into quite a lot of detail about Wikipedia, why it‚Äôs important, how to avoid messing it up, and how best to leverage it in the Knowledge Graph course.


Crunchbase sometimes ranks on page one, but most often ranks pages two, three downwards. 
Things that help your Crunchbase profile rank
1 - there is a lot of information
2 - that information is linked to other pages on Crunchbase
3 - the references on the page to other pages are highly relevant
4 - the latest information is recent

But these sites allow you to link out to your social accounts and profile pages. Which will help those to rank. So you have every interest to update these informational sites with up to date information about your social profile, social accounts, your profile pages, and even your profile pages on sites that you guest blog for.

And for all this work, there are bonuses for your wider SEO and marketing strategies. Here are some.
With social, you're creating community, widening your audience, and improving your content strategy, especially if you integrate it into your global content strategy. 
With review sites, you are boosting your online reputation in the eyes of both users and Google.
With guest blogging, you are widening your audience, improving your content strategy, creating quality inbound links, and  increasing your own authority.
Your work on profile pages will help Google better understand who you are and what you do - and that helps with your Knowledge Graph presence. 
Adding and correcting facts about you on informational sites also helps with your Knowledge Graph presence. 

For all of these leapfrogger candidate that you partially control, don‚Äôt hesitate to also use appropriate techniques described in the lesson about leapfrogger candidate you don‚Äôt control."
Explanation of How to Leapfrog Using Content You Do Not Control in. the Context of Negative Results on Your Brand SERP	"There's the bad result you want to leapfrog with other content that is more positive for your brand.
Below it, perhaps on page 1, perhaps page 2, there is content on a third party site that is a great candidate for leapfrogging. What can you do to push this better content up your Brand SERP, leapfrog the negative content and push that down the SERP? 

 You're going to do SEO for others -  Promote content that isn‚Äôt yours  :) If you haven‚Äôt watched the SEO episode in this course, then please do so. Most of the techniques in that episode are applicable and helpful to doing SEO for others.

Important point. This takes a great deal of patience. Doing SEO for the others is slower than doing SEO for yourself because you don't have direct control and cannot apply many important SEO techniques yourself. But if you're patient, this works.

In the following I will use the terms ‚Äúleapfrogger‚Äù for the third party quality content you are promoting and trying to push up. And ‚Äúleapfroggee‚Äù for the negative content you are trying to push down.

Link to the content
The first thing you can do is link to the leapfrogger from your own site. Make sure the link on your site to the leapfrogger is in the main content of a page, not from the footer. You want to make sure that Google sees that this leapfrogger content you are linking to is important to you. The link needs to be in a piece of content on your site that is relevant to the leapfrogger content. Since the third party leapfrogger content is about your brand, then your Homepage is the obvious candidate. That is frequently the most powerful page on your site and a link there will have most effect. It is also the page that Google ranks #1 for searches on your brand, so it is Google‚Äôs ‚Äòr√©f√©rence‚Äô to your brand. If you don‚Äôt want to link from your homepage, then the about us page is another great candidate as is is very focussed on your company. 

Beyond that, there are other possibilities. Which one you choose will depend on the relationship between your brand and the third party. If the third party is a partner, then you can link from your ‚Äúpartners‚Äù page, if you have one. If it is a review platform, a link from your reviews page would be appropriate. If the leapfrogger content is on a site you consider to be press, then a link from your press section would be a good bet. You might even think about creating a dedicated article or blog post about the other brand and link to the leapfrogger content from there. 

Some pointers about how to optimise the effectiveness of the link.
Make sure that the copy around the link on your site is contextually relevant to the leapfrogger content. Ideally, in the copy, you would explain the relationship between your brand and the third party. Preferably using a semantic triple. In copywriting, a semantic triple expresses the relationship between two entities in a manner that Google finds relatively easy to understand. Simply stated, a semantic triple is subject, verb, object, where the subject and object are entities and the verb describes the relationship.

Indicating the relationship very explicitly in this way will add a little extra encouragement to Google to rank that leapfrogger content on your Brand SERP. An example would be ‚ÄúAmazon sells Acme widgets‚Äù if we were trying to rank an Amazon page on the Acme Brand SERP. Amazon is an entity, Acme widgets is an entity, adn sells is the relationship between them. 

Lastly, use your brand name in the anchor text - that is another signal to Google. In this particular case, we would put the link on the word Acme.

Get links to the leapfrogger content
You can also try and obtain other links for that content. Do some link building for the leapfrogger content, just like you would for your own site. The tactics are the same, the difference is just that it is for someone else :)
And this type of linkbuilding has an advantage. Because you are not asking for a link to your site, it doesn't look like you're promoting your own content or your own interests, so website owners are more open to listening and giving you the link that you want. 

Here are a selection linkbuilding suggestions - by no means complete since there are so many ways to approach linkbuilding

Broken link opportunities. At its simplest, this technique is finding broken links to other, very similar content, contacting the website and suggesting the page you are promoting as a good replacement.
Platforms such as SEMrush, Majestic or aHrefs have great tools to help you do this. 

You can find relevant articles, then reach out to the author and suggest the leapfrogger content as a good a good candidate for a link or an article they have written. Remember, you aren‚Äôt asking for a link to your site, so they may be more open to the idea.
Add links to relevant business knowledge bases such as Crunchbase and generalist knowledge bases such as Wiki data. Pushing that further, you could add links to specialist, niche knowledge bases such as IMDB if the leapfrogger content is about films, or the registry of American dentists, if the leapfrogger content is relevant to dentistry. 

Guest Blogging
You might want to consider writing a relevant guest blog on a relevant site and include a link to the leapfrogger content. You might also take the opportunity to link to yourself. Two birds with one stone.

Working with the publisher of the leapfrogger content
You can also reach out and start building or improving the relationship you have with the publisher. You can offer help them optimise the page page to rank better. Be upfront and tell them WHY you are offering help, but point out that the work will help their content rank better for ALL its keywords, and thus generate visibility and traffic for them, not only on your Brand SERP, but also across other topics. So you are offering them a win-win.

 Please do watch the episode about SEO tactics. There are lots of tactics in there that can help you help them. Make sure you suggest only tactics that are appropriate. And then make it easy for them. Do as much of the work as you possibly can. For example, for technical improvements, you could prepare a mini tech audit for their tech team. You could write, or improve, the schema markup for them. You could offer to provide something multimedia - maybe an image,or an infographic or a video. You could suggest a better meta title and description and H1. Maybe even offer help to optimise the writing itself. 

You DO need to be tactful, though. This offer of help could VERY easily be interpreted as telling them that their content isn't good enough, so this approach is a little bit delicate. But you can certainly offer your help, and if you do it intelligently, and it all works out, they will be grateful. 

You could also barnacle the leapfrogger content onto your content strategy. Some ideas would be to invite the publisher onto your podcast or webinar series, or a video interview or write a blog post about them and then you can include another VERY relevant link pointing to the leapfrogger content from your own site. Having multiple links to the leapfrogger content from your site is a good thing. The law of diminishing returns does apply, so don‚Äôt put too much effort into multiple additional links from your site to the leapfrogger content. 

Suggest that the third party repurposes the leapfrogger content, if that is appropriate. Watch the content strategy episodes for more information on how to do that. 

Leveraging your social audience
Remember that engagement is a major signal to Google that a piece of given content is relevant and brings value to your audience and is therefore a great candidate to rank on page 1 of your Brand SERP. If you are promoting the leapfrogger content to your audience on social media, this indicates that you feel the content is valuable to them. 

That is already a signal to Google, but if you can get your audience to engage with the content in the form of likes, shares, coomments and so on, Google sees that this leapfrogger content IS valuable to your audience. Twitter is likely to be particularly effective since it feeds directly into Google, so Google sees all this content, whereas on Facebook Linkedin and the other social platforms, it cannot crawl 100% of the vast amount of content they generate. A few years ago, I heard the figure on 30% of Facebook gets crawled and indexed by Google. I have no idea if that is true, but it is helpful to emphasis the point that Google misses much of this social content and engagement. 

Publish a relevant article on LinkedIn or Medium. An article on this type of platforms is still social media, but is less here-today-gone -tomorrow than most social media content. Driving engagement on this type of article is more effective and can be done for longer than most content on social media. 

Leveraging your subscribers 
You could also promote that leapfrogger content through an email blast. The idea is not so much to increase the visits to the content, but to generate engagement. So in the blast, encourage your subscribers to share and perhaps add comments or reviews to the content, if that is a possibility. Once again, more engagement will push that content up because Google will perceive it as more relevant and more valuable to the people who are searching for your brand.

Leverage your network. 
You can ask people within your network to promote the content. Someone you know might have an article on a site they control that would be appropriate for a link to the leapfrogger content. Someone might be able to publish an article on their site that includes a link. Someone else might be willing to share it on social media, in which case you can then reshare, comment and push this OTHER person talking about the leapfrogger content to your audience.

DO remain open minded as well. When you're talking to other people in your network, perhaps they have relevant ideas to get some traction for this evergreen content you have not thought of. 


There are many other ideas for getting traction for content. In this episode I have just included techniques I have used that have been successful.

Remember that, as with all SEO,Google looks at many, many factors. It is very rare that any one single action you take will get the results you want. So make sure you plan and execute multiple optimisations.

 Now what not to do.

Don't bully or try to impose things on the third party. They're the content owner and what they do with that content is obviously their decision. Changing their content to suit your needs is not necessarily something that will appeal to them. Or perhaps this isn‚Äôt in their priorities. Try to convince with them with solid and friendly reasoning - after all, this work will help them too. But get upset of too pushy. 

Don't impose irrelevant content on your audience, or your network of connections. If the leapfrogged content isn‚Äôt going to be helpful and useful for them, don‚Äôt shove it down their throats. Firstly your relationship with them will suffer. But also, if the content isn‚Äôt helpful and useful, they won‚Äôt engaged and your efforts will have no effect on your Brand SERP.

Don't spam, buy engagement or deceive. I don‚Äôt advise that in this course for your own site and brand‚Ä¶ but here is is even more sensitive and an even WORSE idea because you are playing with someone else‚Äôs reputation. 
You could inadvertantly damage their reputation, damage their business, and that will ruin any relationship you have with them and could lead to legal trouble.  

 Thank you.



Partner sites 
These can be very powerful - they are naturally relevant to your business, you have a relationship with them already,  and they have a good reason to help you - so asking for changes should not meet with too much resistance.
The exact tactics to employ will be very much case by case, but typically you can suggest a more brand centric title, description, and content, and links to your site, adding video or images, adding schema,  user generated content such as reviews and comments...
A 4 or 5 star journalist review is a great candidate. 
It's a double opportunity. 
Not only can you improve your Brand SERP with an independent review from a respected journalist‚Ä¶ but you can start or improve your relationship with the publisher or the journalist‚Ä¶ and that can be great for future content opportunities and collaboration. 

Any positive article from a blogger or journalist is also a double opportunity in the same way.

Why such a short section on third party content?
Because the variety is so vast and, beyond articles and journalist reviews, picking individual examples would be confusing. 

Also because I tend to go mostly for leapfrogger content that I control or partially control. Prioritising those gives me control of the SERP, and that brings me security and peace of mind. That isn‚Äôt an absolute rule, of course. Great content from third parties your audience trusts can bring a lot to the table."
Introduction to SERP Features in the Context of Brand SERPs	"Over the last couple of years, Google has been introducing rich elements to its SERPs at a stunning rate. The more time goes by, the more rich elements Google introduces, the more space they take up on the SERP and the more Google is becoming a multimedia results engine. That means rich elements are fundamentally important all your SEO efforts.

On Brand SERPs, rich elements often reduce the number of results on the page and that makes your Brand SERP easier for you to control. 
Beyond that, they are key to making your Brand SERP look professional and convincing. Without them, your brand looks lame. 

Let‚Äôs have a quick look at this SERP. This is my personal Brand SERP.

Let's have a closer look at this part. I triggered Twitter boxes. They look great, allow me to control the message ‚Ä¶ and I can get something fresh and engaging onto my personal Brand SERP 15 seconds. How cool is that?

How did I get those? I spent a year tweeting every single day, and getting relevant people to engage with my Tweets. Watch the lesson about Twitter boxes to learn how you can trigger them.

I‚Äôve got video boxes. What did I do? I published quality video content that got engagement from my audience. Watch the lesson about Video boxes to learn how you can trigger them on your Brand SERP.

The reason Google added these rich elements is because it feels that those videos and those Twitter boxes have value for its users when they're Googling for my name. 

On this SERP we have the images. 
And on this one, we have People Also Ask. 

In all these cases, the brand looks more professional, more convincing and the user has understood quite a lot about the brand with a quick read of the SERP. Then there are a lot of visual and textual clues to help that person decide which piece of content is likely to be  most relevant and valuable to them. 
And that‚Äôs a good user experience :)

So, rich elements are key. Their emergence and phenomenal growth over the last few years has changed the game. I had conversations with Gary Ilyes from Google and Frederic Dubut at Bing about how they‚Äôre triggered and that led me to this conclusion :

As marketers, we now have the capacity to shape the ANATOMY of a SERP by triggering different rich elements. That is a very powerful insight for any SERP, but especially so for your Brand SERPs - Triggering and optimising relevant rich elements on your Brand SERP means changing its anatomy and making it sexy.

The first lesson in this course is all about how ranking works in Google, including how Google decides whether or not to put a particular rich element in the SERP.

Understanding that process will be very, very helpful when you are working on triggering right elements for your Brand SERP, so don‚Äôt skip that lesson.

There are dozens of different rich elements, and Google is releasing new ones very regularly. Not all of them appear on Brand SERPs, so not all of them will be included in this course. I‚Äôll restrict the course to rich elements you can trigger on your Brand SERP.

In this introductory lesson, I‚Äôll run through the main candidates. For some, I already have techniques for triggering them and managing them and you‚Äôll find  a lesson for each of those already in the course.

For the others, I haven‚Äôt created a dedicated lesson yet because I haven‚Äôt gathered enough data and haven‚Äôt had enough experience with triggering them. The important word there is ‚Äúyet‚Äù :) - the idea of shaping the anatomy of the SERP by triggering and managing rich elements is an obsession for me, so I‚Äôll figure them out :)

Kalicube is tracking the SERPs for over 20,000 brands in 6 countries and I‚Äôm analysing the data from those to see which rich elements appear when, where, why and for whom. I‚Äôll do some testing and then add lessons for each rich element as and when I have solid data, and experience. 

That means this course will be updated more often than the others. 

Here‚Äôs a quick run through of the rich elements I currently have in my sights. 

Rich Sitelinks
This is the most basic, and least rich in this list. I covered these in the fundamentals course since they are attached to the homepage and fairly simple to trigger for most brands. 

Very Rich Sitelinks
On mobile, Google can get quite ambitious with these. When it considers content  on the brand‚Äôs site relevant and valuable to the user, it can show quite a range of other media in the rich sitelinks space. I have seen videos, images‚Ä¶. And we may well soon see audio and products.

Video boxes. 
Google shows thumbnails of multiple videos that the user can click through to and watch. They look great, are very visible, take up more space than a traditional blue link, and often kill a blue link.

Twitter boxes.
These are really great to have on your Brand SERP since you control the content they display. Twitter Boxes contain images, and video, and they allow you to push real time messages out to your audience. They also take up two places in the SERP and often kill a blue link. 

People also ask
This shows questions that are related to whatever the person has searched for. Google has become very keen on these and as of January 2020, they appear on over 50% of all searches. That figure is lower on Brand SERPs - closer to 30%, but they are really important since their presence is growing. They also take up two places in the SERP and often kill a blue link. 

Images boxes
They are often overlooked. Obviously they are pretty visual and catch the eye. They appear in Brand SERPs quite a lot, although their presence is diminishing. As of January 2020, they appear on 25% of Brand SERPs. Image Boxes are a relatively easy rich element to get and a reasonable target for smaller brands with a limited content strategy budget.

Related searches. 
They show users potential searches that are ontologically related to your brand. That just means in the same category. Right now for brands, they tend to be pretty simple, like the one on the left. But that is changing fast.

For people - in this case Russell Brand, which is quite a nice joke - we see multiple groups of related searches, organised by topic or entity. As Google applies multiple related searches boxes to brands, this type of result will show things like competing companies, related products and people with associated with the brand‚Ä¶ and probably much more besides!

The featured snippet, 
That's the result right at the top. Google‚Äôs aim is to provide the ‚Äòbest‚Äô answer to the user. 
It gives the answer Google thinks is correct. These are rare on Brand SERPs since the homepage block with the rich sitelinks and the Knowledge Panel fulfill the role of ‚Äúanswer‚Äù. 

Knowledge Card
A mixture between a featured snippet and a Knowledge Panel since they give the answer at the top of the SERP, but provide related information from the Knowledge Graph. Once again, rare on Brand SERPs.

Events. 
These appear on the right hand side in a Brand SERP. Sources for these include Facebook, and the brands own site. Google will show an event on a Brand SERP if the brand has an event organized in the near future, and it considers the event is relevant for the user.

Podcast. 
Podcasts appear more and more frequently in many different types of SERP. In Brand SERPs, as of January 2020, I have only seen podcasts in personal Brand SERPs of famous podcasters such as Marc Maron. I haven‚Äôt seen Google show podcasts for brands., but I believe they will - if a brand-run podcast is popular enough, then it will become relevant and valuable to people searching that brand name, and Google will then show it on the Brand SERP.

Top Stories
The top stories box contains fresh and breaking news so they only appear in Brand SERPs for brands that receive a lot of press attention, and they are not directly controllable. 

Latest from
This is basically Top Stories, but pulled only from the brand‚Äôs site. Once again this is limited to bigger brands, specifically bigger brands that publish a lot of content.

Interesting finds
This is part of Google‚Äôs attempt to push relevant related information into the SERP to help the user explore around the topic. Interesting finds contains evergreen news, guides and articles about the brand. 

Products
When the brand has products, and Google is confident it has understood the relationship between the two, it can show products on the Brand SERP. This is currently limited to bigger brands.

There are many others including apps, stock prices, recipes, Send to Google Home, Jobs‚Ä¶ the list goes on. In the supplementary material, you‚Äôll find a list from December 2019 provided by Wordlift. Some will certainly disappear, and new ones will appear‚Ä¶ and not all are applicable to Brand SERPs."
Explanation of Universal Search on Search Engines Like Google and Bing	"When you are doing SEO, it is really really important to understand the mechanisms behind Google‚Äôs ranking system.

I call it Darwinism in search. 

This is something that Gary Ilyes from Google told me in May 2019, and it makes SO much sense. At Bing the ranking works in very much the same way - Fr√©d√©ric Dubut, the team lead for the blue link algorithm at Bing explained much the same system to me in November 2019. 
Understanding this system for ranking both the blue links and the rich elements changed the way I approach SEO, revolutionised my thinking about Brand SERPs. I have over  20 years of experience working on SEO, and have been working specifically on Brand SERPs since 2014.

But it was this explanation from Gary and Frederic that brought the final pieces to the puzzle for this course.

We‚Äôll start with this very boring Brand SERP.
10 blue links. Just a few years ago, this was what we got from Google.  These days, the 10 blue links hardly ever exist. And when we DO get a SERP with just the 10 blue links, it seems somehow incomplete. For a Brand SERP the effect is to make the brand look bad. At best boring. At worst, not credible.

I've been working on my personal Brand SERP for five years and I've managed to get a really nice SERP. On the right we have the Knowledge Panel, then I have the Twitter boxes, the image boxes, and the video boxes. 
Any item in a SERP that is not a blue link is called a Rich element.
Question: How does Google decide which SERPs contain rich elements, which rich elements appear and how many rich elements?

Google WANTS to return multimedia SERPs like this one. Often, the content that brings most value to its users is multimedia. It is quick, easy to consume and engaging, which is what many people are looking for. It is less and less the case that a blue link really helps the user quickly and efficiently. 

One problem it has is that the multimedia content that is out there is not sufficiently good. It doesn't bring sufficient value to its users. 
On Brand SERPs this is particularly true. The user already knows something about the brand since they are searching its name. If they are navigating to your site, then just the top of the page is enough for them. If they are researching your brand as a potential client, journalist, investor‚Ä¶ whatever, then ten blue links doesn‚Äôt really satisfy their needs very well. 

Clicking on a blue link,  looking at the content, clicking back, clicking on another blue link, reading that content, clicking back. Then worse, clicking on a click-bait meta title, looking at the content, being disappointed, clicking back‚Ä¶ The user is wasting time, getting frustrated‚Ä¶ and Google doesn‚Äôt look good.

Multimedia elements on a SERP give both more information about the brand, but also more clues as to what the user will find when they DO click on the link. So multimedia Brand SERPs are better for everyone.

Let‚Äôs have a quick look at this SERP. My personal Brand SERP that I have worked on and shaped since 2014.

Let's have a closer look. The Twitter boxes. Nice ! How did I get those? I spent a year tweeting every single day, and getting relevant people to engage with my Tweets. Look here. I can get something new onto my personal Brand SERP in 51 seconds. In fact, it can be as fast as 15 seconds. How cool is that?

We‚Äôve got the videos. What did I do? I published at least one video a month for a year. Here engagement seems to have been less important than for the Twitter boxes. But it is still necessary. 

The reason Google is putting this up here is because it feels that those videos and those Twitter boxes have value for its users when they're searching for my name. 

Then we have the Knowledge Panel. That is a lot of information about me, very clear, easy to digest and right there on the SERP.

On THIS Brand SERP, the user has understood a lot about me with a quick read of the SERP. Then there are a lot of visual and textual clues to help that person decide which piece of content is likely to be  most relevant and valuable to them. 

THAT is a good user experience :)"
Explanation of How Universal Search Functions on Search Engines Like Google and Bing	"So, the BIG question I am going to answer is ‚Äúhow does Google decide on where and when to put rich elements. And indeed WHICH rich elements to put on a SERP.

To get some context, we need to come back to the blue links. How does the ranking system for those work?

By the way, all the numbers in the following presentation are completely fictional. The scores start near zero, but could go up to millions, or just thousands, or hundreds. The numbers are just to demonstrate how this functions. And I kept them low to keep things manageable.

Here we have the aspects that affect ranking - you might call them rankings factors - each contains multiple signals. Topicality, quality, speed, entities, RankBrain, structured data, freshness‚Ä¶ there are others, but these are the ones Gary Illyes confirmed. 

Each of these factors contains multiple signals. For example, quality will include accuracy, inbound links‚Ä¶ Structured data would include HTML tables, lists, schema.org markup. 

Each group of signals - you can still call them ranking factors if you want to - provides a score. The algorithm takes these scores and multiplies them together to get a total score. 

Why have I written bid if I'm saying score? Because Google use the term bid. And it's not bid in a monetary sense. It's not bid in the sense how much is somebody paying, or even willing to pay‚Ä¶ It is bid in the terms of the value it can bring to Google's user in the context in which that user finds themselves. So every single blue link is bidding for that top spot. And its bid is a multiplication of its score in the different groups of signals.

Now, if a piece of content has a score that is less than one in ANY of the groups of signals, the bid will tank. If you‚Äôre good at maths, you‚Äôll know that in multiplication, when ANY of the numbers is less than one, the total goes down drastically. That means it is vital to have content that doesn‚Äôt fail drastically on ANY of the groups of signals.

Here‚Äôs a school analogy‚Ä¶ Much better to be a straight C student than get three A's and an F. 

Quick handy tip - it is an improvement in your weakest area that will have most effect on boosting your ranking. If you want to improve your rankings for any search query, identify where you're weakest and improve that. If you've got 100,000 links, one extra link makes very little difference. If you've got one link, one extra link makes a lot of difference. If you have text, but no structured data on your page, then adding some will make more difference than writing more text.

So, Google ends up with this‚Ä¶ what we used to have three or four years ago. The 10 blue links, ranked by order of the bid they have given for the value they will bring to the user in the context that user finds him or herself in.

THEN what does it do? It filters. It has a secondary algorithm that filters the results and adapts those top results that recalibrate them and make them even more relevant to the users query.

And here we have the final bids that, until 2014 or so, filled the whole SERP‚Ä¶ and we have these incredibly boring 10 blue links. This is Kalicube in mid 2019, by the way. This is my company, so I'm not criticising anybody.

Kalicube had the 10 blue links because it hadn't yet posted videos for a year or tweeted for a year or got in the Knowledge Graph. And the boringness of that SERP was a big red flag to me that got me to rethink my content strategy, and my Knowledge Graph strategy.

SO, how has Google expanded out to be able to include rich elements that disrupt this SERP without messing with the core algorithm? 
If you think about it they CAN‚ÄôT drastically change that core algorithm both because it‚Äôs too big and complex, but also because it is the foundation on which their entire business model is built. 
If they get THAT core algorithm majorly wrong, their business collapses !

Now, Google wants to push rich elements such as news, images, video, feature snippet, Twitter boxes without messing with the core algorithm. 

It does that by using the same algorithm on each, but with bespoke weighting applied to the signals‚Ä¶ and for some rich elements, they add additional signals JUST for that element - alt tags for images would be an example of a factor that is unique to them. 

Rich elements are organised in groups by type. Each type provides a ranked result and submits a bid to try to gain a place on the SERP. 
They are candidates for a place on that SERP. So we can call these candidate sets. 

A quick word on how Google organises the people behind the algorithm. 
There is a team for the blue link algorithm, with a team lead driving the direction those results are taking, enclosing their visual presentation, and the rich aspects in this such as siteelinks, dates and review stars. 

There is a team for the video candidate set, with a team lead driving the direction those results are taking, including the weightings of the signals in the calculation of the bids for videos, but also the presentation of the results. 
There is a team for the news candidate set and so on and so on.

So, how does the ranking in candidate sets function? Each piece of content in a candidate set submits a bid by multiplying across the scores for those groups of signals - remember, signals that have different weightings for each rich element type. The candidate set then has a ranked result set limited to only THAT type of rich element.

Each candidate set has it‚Äôs champion. It‚Äôs best bid of value to the user in the context of the user - the context of the user being geo location, device, intent, time of day etc 

It submits it‚Äôs bids to the core algorithm, which has it‚Äôs list of 10 blue links. If the top result of a candidate set provides a bid that is higher than the top blue link, that means it brings more value to the user for the question they have asked or the problem they need to solve in the context the user finds themselves in.
It is therefore given a place on that SERP.

THAT‚ÄôS how you drive those rich elements. Leapfrogging blue links with rich √©l√©ments that bring more value. 

Featured snippets are a great demonstration of how this works. For years, we‚Äôve been looking at those and their ability to leapfrog the blue links. THAT is how they do it !

So, forgetting Brand SERPs for just a moment, if you want to get a place on the SERP for any user search query, writing blog posts, and competing for blue links is probably no longer the best approach anymore. Perhaps better to create content specifically for those rich element candidate sets aimed at bringing more value to the user than the existing blue links. 

If a video provides a great solution to Google's user, make a video. You leapfrog everything else. Same for images, podcasts, news and so on.

And that's how Google makes these multimedia SERPs. And if you think about it, there isn't any other way they can do it at scale. They can't write individual algorithms that have specific rules, signals and weightings for the different rich elements. One environment and one set of rules for life system that applies to all.

 I would say that it's Darwinistic. If you are stronger, bring more value to the user in their current context, you get a place - replacing a blue link. In fact, you kill a blue link because when you get that place with a rich element, a blue link disappears off the bottom of the SERP. It dies.

 In some cases, you kill two blue links. If you get the video boxes here, we can see immediately it takes two places. TWO blue link drop off the bottom of the page onto page two. For related searches, things can go even further. Related Searches on Russel Brand‚Äôs personal Brand SERP have killed THREE blue links. 

So when we now say the blue links are slowly disappearing, they're disappearing because of this. Will the blue links die out? Probably one day in the distant future. That's Darwinism. Survival of the fittest.

Quick word about teams here. There is a ‚ÄúWhole Page‚Äù team that works on what the whole page will look like. I don‚Äôt have confirmation from Google or Bing about exactly how that team intervenes, but an educated guess is that it has an algorithm that ‚Äôshapes‚Äô the SERP according to intent. The placement of the rich elements, the exact presentation format and certainly other aspects.

So the Darwinism has a bias. 

That leads us to the idea that you can shape the anatomy of SERPs. That idea can usefully be applied to any SERP‚Ä¶
 but shaping the anatomy of the SERP should be an OBSESSION for your Brand SERPs. 

Luckily, Brand SERPs have natural tendency to be multimedia, and a tendency to display rich elements containing content produced by the brand. So, with time and work, you will be able to shape the anatomy of your Brand SERP, and that obsession will not be frustrating for too long :)

Here‚Äôs an example of a brand that is doing a good job  shaping its SERP. They‚Äôve got the nice video boxes. The Image boxes. The Twitter boxes. They also have the Knowledge Panel‚Ä¶ they have been shaping the anatomy of their SERP by creating rich content that is valuable to their audience, and that their audience engages with. 

To get the video boxes, they have created lots of video content. They appear on webinars. They're creating a reason for Google to put this content in the SERP because it knows that when a users searches for that brand, they are interested in learning what they have to say. And video is great for that. 

Your aim is to fill your Brand SERPs with rich √©l√©ments that bring joy and wonder and glorious beauty. Your brand looks better to your audience. You look credible. You look trustworthy. You look authoritative. And you look expert.

You‚Äôll notice I just mentioned expertise, authority and trust - otherwise referred to as E-A-T by Google. Your Brand SERP is a reflection of Google‚Äôs view of your E-A-T. 

Once Google is showing content in your Brand SERP, especially rich content, that communicates your credibility to your audience, and also means Google thinks you are Expert, Authoritative and Trustworthy... You are winning the E-A-T game.

Understanding the mechanism behind Google‚Äôs ranking system, and that it has integrated rich elements alongside its core algorithm in a manner that allows them to leapfrog the blue links, and kill them off, is crucial to working more effectively on actively shaping the anatomy of your Brand SERP."
Explanation of Images Boxes (or Carousels) in the Context of Brand SERPs	"Approxcimately 25% of Brand SERPs contain image boxes and they bring multiple advantages:
If the images are good quality, it brings a big visual plus to your Brand SERP. It is a lovely opportunity for strong, visual branding and a great way to communicate a solid brand message - an image is worth a thousand words.

Image boxes are one of the easiest rich element to get for your Brand SERP - interestingly, we never see image boxes and video boxes together. 

Brands with a strong video strategy will tend to have video boxes rather than image boxes.  Smaller brands can trigger those video boxes using the techniques in the video boxes lesson in this course‚Ä¶ but if your don‚Äôt yet have much video, or after watching the video box lesson you realise your videos are not relevant enough, then image boxes are a great shorter term option - they‚Äôre easy to trigger, and won‚Äôt take a long time, even for smaller brands. 

Having images in Google already is a big help, but just to show how easy this can be, here‚Äôs an example of a small, local brand that triggered them within a few months of creating the company. 

So what to do

The overall approach is to see images as an integral part of your content strategy and use quality visuals - across all your content and communication. 

Start by working on the basis that every page should have an image - and often multiple images. For mobile SERPs that is now a ‚Äòmust‚Äô as we can see here. But, globally, the more visuals Google has to work with, the better when you are aiming to trigger image boxes.

Importantly, when looking at images for individual pages, it is easy to lose sight of the bigger picture - how each image fits into the wider image bank that exists around your brand. Images don‚Äôt exist in isolation, especially in image boxes and on Google image search. Think about how images look on their own, but also when taken in groups, and also in the context of your brand image. 

This is a great example. The brand message is clear and strong, the brand image is consistent. 

This example is less good. This was Kalicube a year ago. I was thinking image by image, page by page, social media post by social media post. Very piecemeal. I didn't think about the images as a group and in the wider context of the brand message I wanted to communicate. And that became VERY obvious when I got the image boxes. It‚Äôs inconsistent, a bit of a mix, and doesn‚Äôt reflect well on my brand. 

And this is a little bit more difficult to correct than you might imagine. 
In order to get image boxes that look really good, and reflect well on my brand, I need to start by creating a set of guidelines for me, my team and third party sites. Those guidelines include a list of colors to use, acceptable typefaces, where and when the logo should be included ‚Ä¶ a mini design bible.

Think about incorporating your logo into images where doing so is reasonable. Do that either as a watermark or as a small additional element on one of the edges. You don't want to overdo it. You want to keep this direct branding quite subtle - Google will tend not to show images that are overwhelmed by the logo - unless, of course it IS the logo :)

Next up is to make sure your images respect the guidelines you set out optimise them on your own site, then push them out to third party sites and platforms. It‚Äôs a lot of work. 

By getting this right on all the visuals you publish from today onwards, those visuals will rise to the top, and drown the old ones. 

Every time you add images to your pages, or to third party sites... and when you share them on social, ALWAYS follow the SEO rules I‚Äôm going the share. When you send images to other people to add to their content, always encourage them to apply as many of these SEO rules as possible.

Here are the 10 rules of image SEO. 
Rule #1
Consistent, relevant vocabulary. Make sure that you've got the vocabulary that represents your brand, your products, and also that appeals to your audience. 
Build yourself a lexicon. If you define a lexicon right at the start, then naming the files and writing alt tags, titles, captions and text around the images will be much quicker, easier and you‚Äôll be more consistent, and stay on focus. And being consistent and staying on focus is key if you want these images to be seen as a group, and dominate your SERPs.

Rule #2
The filename describes the content of the image. Name entities when appropriate. jason-barnard-interviews-john-mueller.png  
Don‚Äôt make the filenames too long - short, sweet and accurate. And you‚Äôll notice I used subject, verb, object to describe the image - that‚Äôs a good thing to do since it communicates more clearly than something like interview-john-mueller-jason-barnard.png  

Rule #3
The alt tag also describes the content of the image. Take the filemame as the basis. That‚Äôs logical since the filename also describes the content of the image. But you can push it a bit further. Jason Barnard interviews John Mueller July 2019. 

The additional information adds some context. In this case, the date is relevant. In another case, the colors might be. Or the scenery. Or the weather. Use alt tags to add a little context. 

Remember what purpose alt tags actually serve - they are for screenreaders for blind people. Adding the context makes sense for them. And to Google since Google is looking primarily at the HTML, and in that sense it is blind :)

Alt tags are NOT for keyword stuffing. Remember that Google has the capacity to scan the image and understand what‚Äôs in that image. It doesn‚Äôt do that for every image every week or month‚Ä¶ but it will scan the image and see what you are up to sooner or later. 

Rule #4
Add a title. It will show when the user hovers over the image with their mouse.  If the image is clickable, then your title will contain a call to action. ‚ÄúJason Barnard interviews John Mueller. Click here to see the video‚Äù, for example. 

If the image isn‚Äôt clickable, then the title will be a description that adds some additional relevant context for the user. This time you can add context that isn‚Äôt necessarily visible in the image itself. ‚ÄúJason Barnard interviews John Mueller at Google‚Äôs offices - Zurich July 2019‚Äù
That additional information can prove useful to the user and is ALWAYS helpful to Google.

Rule #5
Add a caption if it‚Äôs appropriate to do so. This can be the same as the title, or something different. Another way to add extra context, and an opportunity to be a little more creative. ‚ÄúJason Barnard and John Mueller having a laugh discussing life at Google‚Äù
That not only makes this image come alive for the user, it adds even more context for Google.

Rule #6
Use semantic HTML5. Looking here, you can see that the texts I just added all have a direct HTML relationship with the image. The filename and alt are within the img tag, then the figure tag encapsulates that AND the caption, explicitly indicating to Google that all of this information applies to the same thing. The image. Joining all that together and tying it to the image is really neat and tidy, and incredibly powerful from an SEO standpoint.

Rule #7
The accompanying text around the image is incredibly important. Google now analyses the text that surrounds the image to get more context. The words around the image should add LOTS more context. This is where the lexicon in rule #1 comes in especially handy.

Rule #8
Minimize the filesize. Google wants to be able to deliver the images quickly and efficiently. Have a look at tools like TinyPng to get the filesize of the original down to a minimum. 

Rule #9
This is something you can‚Äôt usually apply on any third party sites.
Make sure you provide all the meta information in the head section of your page as you can. This data tells browsers and some other machines which image to use from a page. If you explicitly indicate one of your hyper-optimised images, that image will get shared and shown around the web, and that will help it rank and show in your image boxes.
Using Wordpress and Yoast, you can easily change the meta data. Like this. 

Rule #10
Schema and meta data. This is also something you can‚Äôt apply on any third party sites. Schema markup helps machines understand which content they should use, if you indicate clearly to them that THIS is the image they should take from the page, they will.
Here‚Äôs an example of  ‚ÄòprimaryImageOfPage‚Äô - you are telling Google and other machines to use this image to represent this page and Google will tend to see the images you identify as being important, and that will increase the probability that they will appear in your Brand SERP image boxes. 
 
This looks complicated. And it is. But some CMS platforms do this for you. For example, WordPress with Yoast does this using the Featured Image for a page.

Do all of this optimisation on images on your site first.
Start with the main images that you want to appear in your Brand SERP. You need to choose at least a dozen since Google will not necessarily show what you want it to show. 

Since you have no control over which images appear in your image boxes, it‚Äôs a good idea to optimise as many as you can. 
And that carries the bonus that you‚Äôll appear more in Google image search, which is great for brand awareness, especially if you have created a recognisable visual identity. 
Plus, good image SEO will help your pages perform slightly better in the normal SERPs.

Now that you've optimized the images on your own site, you have sent a strong signal to Google which images are important for you. Next is to send a signal that these images are also seen as important by others.

You need to distribute them.
Google uses multiple sources for the image boxes. It won‚Äôt show images only from your site - Google MUCH prefers to pull in images from multiple sources.. So if you don‚Äôt distribute your best images to other sites, one or two images in your image box will almost certainly always be what others have chosen to publish using your name. 

Providing quality visuals to third parties is a really good idea not only for the image boxes on your Brand SERP, but from a wider perspective. It gives you some level of control over what visuals people publish alongside your brand name‚Ä¶ but more than that, if you make people‚Äôs life easier by sending well-prepared visuals, and make their content look better, by providing quality images - that will encourage them to use the images and cite you.  

I know the idea of pushing images out to other sites is a little strange for SEO, but if you don't have your images on different sources, Google will almost certainly not give you the image boxes. 
To trigger those boxes, and fill them with visuals you want to show your audience, you need to push your preferred images out to multiple relevant sites.

First place to start social media.
You control your social media accounts, and your audience is already there, ready to share‚Ä¶ An image that gets social engagement from your audience is an image that Google is likely to perceive as bringing value to users searching your brand name‚Ä¶ so your social accounts are a great way to push images out. 

Images on social that get shared, liked, commented on and generally gain traction with your audience are great candidates for the image boxes.  
This example is YouTube and LinkedIn, but it could also be Facebook or Twitter or Instagram or any other platform that carries images.
 
Offsite image SEO
Now we're going to look at pushing images out to third party sites - remember Google wants to include images from third party sites in the image boxes, even if those images initially came from you. 

Help your partners rank THEIR copy of your images.
Choose several trusted partners and provide them with the images you want to show in image boxes. Then help those partners optimise the visuals by giving them the SEO rules I've shared in this video. 

Provide the necessary alt tags, titles and captions - those are typically things people are lazy about. Metas and Schema markup are also typically an area where third party sites will fail. They might want to do it, and appreciate any help you can give. But it will probably be a step too far.

Helping your partners out like this can also help build a better relationship with them that could well help in other areas of your business partnership.

Journalists and articles
When you get a ‚Äòbite‚Äô from your outreach or PR efforts, provide a great visual, either from your existing images, or by creating one specifically for them... 
Provide the necessary alt tags, titles and captions and optimise the filesize.
  
Guest Blogging
If you write a guest blog, it goes without saying that you should provide quality images that reflect your brand identity. You can easily optimise the filesize, the filename, the alt tag, the title tag, and the caption. You can also make sure that the content around the image helps clarify the context. You won‚Äôt be able to influence the HTML or the schema. But if the site is relevant, powerful and popular, those advantages will outweigh those shortcomings.

Neutral Sites
You can also push your images out to informational third party sites, such as Wikidata, IMDB, Wikipedia and Crunchbase‚Ä¶ 
But also push them out to industry sites and directories. For example, on platforms where you have a profile page that accepts additional images take that opportunity. 
APply as many of the 10 rules of image optimisation as you can. 

Even if you can‚Äôt apply very many, images on powerful informational sites and relevant industry sites will tend to rise to the top very quickly.

That‚Äôs quite a lot of on and offsite image SEO to do. But it will help with your brand identity, improve your visibility on social, improve you image SEO, and get you image boxes that make your Brand SERP really great."
Explanation of Brand Strategy for Video Boxes in the Context of Brand SERPs	"Approximately 25% of Brand SERPs contain video boxes and that number is rising.
They bring  a lot to your SERP - they look great and they take up two places which means that they often kill a blue link - push one blue link right off the bottom of the page. 

Here's a great example from SEMrush. This is the top half of their SERP. They have the home page, the rich site links, and then these great-looking video boxes.
Now they make 500 top quality videos a year. Luckily you don‚Äôt need to be that ambitious, either in quantity or quality. 

Here's a less ambitious example from one of my French clients. They only have five videos - they look quite amateur and most of them are quite old. And yet they get Video Boxes. 

Why?
Because Google perceives video boxes to be relevant and useful to their audience

Here‚Äôs a quick comparison
SEMrush - regular output of dozens of high quality videos a month that get engagement - tens of thousands of views, thousands of likes, loads of comments ‚Ä¶ and all this on their YouTube channel that has tens of thousands of subscribers.

My French client has five videos that they filmed over a period of several years. They have less videos, they add them irregularly, the quality is less professional, the thumbnails are not-so-good, and they get little engagement - they have few views, few likes, few comments ‚Ä¶ and only a few dozen subscribers.  And yet they get the video boxes.

Several things to notice - the video quality in itself doesn't penalize them. The number of videos hasn‚Äôt penalised them. The fact that their videos are not popular hasn‚Äôt either. 

So, why did Google trigger the video boxes? Because it perceives their five videos as being incredibly relevant and helpful to people searching for the brand.

1 - the content of the videos are 100% on topic 
2 - they are how-to videos that are very helpful for the audience
3 - the engagement they DO get is from a very relevant audience

They're a small company, and yet they own half their Brand SERP with their homepage, their rich site links and their video boxes. Brilliant.

What Osyla and SEMrush have in common is a coherent video content strategy. Each is according to their means, but both are demonstratively truly helpful and valuable to a very relevant audience. And importantly, neither talks only about themselves. They are providing useful and helpful content to their target audience, and using that to subtly carry their brand name and brand message. 

So, don‚Äôt be pushy sales-wise. Make sure you brand your videos so that you make the most of every view. But if you overdo your sales-pitch, either visually on screen or in the audio, you‚Äôll put people off‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll lose engagement... and probably the opportunity to convert that person into a client.

This comparison shows really nicely that any business can get video boxes. Businesses with smaller budgets for video can trigger video boxes if they approach their video strategy wisely.
Be relevant, be super-helpful to your core audience, and get engagement from them‚Ä¶ and make sure your videos grab and keep their attention - not necessarily by recording HD video in the studio and adding fancy effects ... but by making videos that are truly useful to core audience.

As a lovely side effect, that pushes sales. I know these particular videos have paid for themselves hundreds of times over.

A note on thumbnails
Osyla hasn‚Äôt made much effort for their thumbnails. On YouTube, thumbnails are vital for driving views, so they missed a trick to expand their audience there. But in the context of a Brand SERP, they have missed an opportunity to make their SERP look a little bit more attractive, and also missed and opportunity to control their brand image. 

Videos in your content strategy.
Making a series of video like this brings multiple advantages. Firstly, of course, the video boxes you trigger on your Brand SERP - they look great, and often kill a blue link. But also, you can use them to push your brand name and brand message out on multiple platforms and reaching new, highly targeted audiences. 

Use your not-self-serving video strategy to build a relevant and faithful audience around your brand and your products. You‚Äôll get honest engagement, and that will trigger the video boxes. But you‚Äôll also get new clients."
Explanation of the STrategy to Get Video Boxes on Your brand SERP	"Make videos for your audience - topics that bring them value, in a format That's suitable for them, on platforms they use. 

Choice of topic
Choose subjects that are a good match between your products and services and the needs of users. 
Videos about your products are sales-y and won‚Äôt get much traction or engagement. Save those for the bottom of funnel when you‚Äôre clinching the deal.
Share information That's more suitable to top and middle of funnel when the user is looking for more general information around a topic, or when they are moving towards finding the solution to a problem.

You have expertise about your products, but more importantly in this context, you have expertise in related areas around your products. Share that expertise with your audience. Be helpful. Bring value. 
Look at this from their point of view. Put yourself in their shoes. Find topics they need help with. Providing video that brings real value to your audience will build your audience, drive engagement, trigger the video boxes‚Ä¶ and maybe even pull people into the acquisition funnel and end in a sale.

Choice of format
There are a lot of different formats you can use for videos. The ones that are suitable for your audience depends on their needs and expectations. Notice the choice depends on what your audience wants, not on your preferences. As with the choice of topics, it is essential that you look at this from THEIR point of view, and make the choices that serve THEIR expectations.

So what formats make great video content?
Here are some ideas that have worked for me, and all of them have brought ranking opportunities for other search terms and gained visibility, traffic and built top and mid-funnel audience.

How to videos about topics related to your products 
These are valuable to your existing clients and they're helpful for your prospects.That makes them perfect candidates for a Brand SERP since they cover multiple types of people Googling your brand name. 

Plus, this type of video will rank in a wider context than just your Brand SERP. They‚Äôll rank when somebody searches for a ‚Äúhow to‚Äù question - and that gives you brand visibility on all sorts of different SERPs, if you optimise them well. 

Video Interviews are another great idea. 
Interviews of your C-level employees are an easy option. But are your audience TRULY interested? Is it helpful to them to know the CEO better? Probably not. 

Better still would be a recognised industry expert or influencer - a famous face always looks good on your SERP, and that will help the Authority and Trust aspects of your E-A-T. You're associating yourself with experts on authoritative figures, which makes you slightly more authoritative and slightly more expert.

Or perhaps a client with a helpful story to tell about how your products helped them with a specific problem? That's really good because a client is someone your prospects can relate to, and they could potentially see a solution to their problem, and that might push them through to convert.

Webinars. 
Invite one or more experts to talk about a topic That's relevant and helpful to your audience, and make sure that the content of the webinar brings value‚Ä¶ That's a win on every front. The promotion you do before will widen your reach. The webinar itself will have an engaged audience - and in that respect, the ‚Äòlive‚Äô aspect is actually quite powerful in people‚Äôs minds. 
And then video remains available after the event, and that gives you the opportunity to continue promoting it and widen your audience further, generate lots of engagement and push it up onto your Brand SERP. 

Make sure not to make it too sales-y - I see this all too often. Pushing your product down people‚Äôs throats too early in the acquisition process is a big turn off. The video is branded, hosted on your channel and your brand name will pop into the conversation at some point. That's enough. Your aim is to make the webinar truly valuable to them and get your name in their mind. You aren‚Äôt going to sell anything to them off the back of this webinar alone, so don‚Äôt overdo it.

Out and about reporting
Here's an example with a GoPro. The interview is about DIY video marketing. Anders Hjorth  on the left has been using his iPhone to film a series of videos that he has moulded into a strategy using multiple formats on multiple platforms - and he's had great success with it. The camerawork and the editing of his videos are not very professional, but the message he is communicating doesn‚Äôt NEED professional quality video, and his audience is comfortable with the DIY aspect.
And my interview of him using GoPro is also adapted to my audience. On the video podcast, people are interested in our conversation, and the video serves more to create context and an atmosphere than anything else.

Conference talks.
I do lots of conferences and the organisers sometimes film them. Those recordings keep popping up in the video boxes too. Talks and public appearances are great opportunities to build brand, build audience on and offline‚Ä¶. And a great way to feed and fill your video boxes.

Lastly, product help videos.
How to and help videos about your own products and services don‚Äôt widen your audience or help fill the funnel from the top‚Ä¶ But they‚Äôre great for existing clients. And they are wonderful for your Brand SERPs because they are truly helpful to your existing audience, so Google likes to put this type of video in front of them when they search your name. 

They‚Äôll also rank well in results when people search Google for information about your products or services. There‚Äôs little top of the funnel audience building here. But you‚Äôll boost bottom-funnel audience and improve your post sales service. 

Now, what resolution to choose? 
As far as is reasonable try to record your videos HD - at least 1920 px x 1080 px - and record uncompressed sound. Starting from that high quality, you can publish them at lower resolution and lower sound quality. But the opposite isn‚Äôt true - if your initial recording is low quality, you can never publish at higher quality. 

That said, as you can see, in these cases, image quality isn't that good, and it hasn‚Äôt killed the value the video brings to the audience. 
The content of the videos is what makes all the difference. Your ideas need to engage, get people involved‚Ä¶ and bring value. The content needs to be interesting to your audience.
THAT‚ÄôS the key - not a big budget with a professional studio, actor and scriptwriter.

Sound quality. Pay particular attention to audio quality. Make sure the sound is as clear as possible, with very little background noise. People won't watch a video all the way through if the sound quality isn't very good or there are lots of distracting noise in the background. 

Now, choose the right platforms.
You need a platform that's appropriate to your audience. Choose platforms where they hang out. Video boxes contain a lot of videos from YouTube, and that's the obvious candidate. But don‚Äôt ignore Facebook, Twitter and even your own site - all of those can get a place on the SERP if Google perceives them as being highly relevant - and that means either optimising them really well if they are on your site, or getting genuine engagement from a relevant audience on social channels."
A Brief Explanation About Repurposing Video COntent in the COntext of SEO	"A quick word on repurposing video content.
I have had a lot of success filling the video boxes with short extracts and teasers I‚Äôve pushed out onto Twitter and YouTube. That is definitely an idea worth pursuing. Pull quotes from your interviews and webinar, and make standalone clips out of them. Record teasers to announce a conference‚Ä¶ there are lots of possibilities, and for video boxes on Brand SERPs Google likes these just as much as the full length videos."
Explanation of How to Optimise Video Content on Different Platforms For SEO	"We'll start with YouTube. They're the really big player. YouTube is the one that fills up most of these video boxes. 

Remember, the key to getting the video boxes is engagement. So you need to optimise to drive views, comments, shares and so on. That obviously has multiple benefits - you‚Äôll better engage with your existing audience, you‚Äôll widen your audience‚Ä¶ and you‚Äôll get the video boxes!

First, you need a YouTube channel. Use your brand name as the Channel name.

Before you start building you channel, think about the vocabulary. The vocabulary you use across everything you post to this channel needs to be very pertinent to your brand and your business and your users.
Think about the words your audience uses and words that are truly relevant to your industry and products. Write them all down in a document because you'll be using them in all the steps that just coming up now. When you look at them as a group, it should be very, very clear immediately what this channel is about. Let‚Äôs call it your context cloud.

Optimise your channel. FIll in all the fields YouTube offers.
The description in particular is important. It should focus on the value this channel will bring to your audience, obviously talking a little about your brand, but don‚Äôt overdo it. This description aims to attract curious viewers on YouTube. Heavy selling is counter-productive. They‚Äôll get your commercial message little by little when they watch your videos.

Then, optimise each and every video
Use a file name that describes the content. If the video is on-topic, that should naturally include vocabulary in your context cloud.

Next, you need a relevant title. If you've your context cloud list to hand, you'll be able to write an attractive, descriptive, well focussed title very quickly. It needs to be pertinent to your audience and pertinent to Google‚Ä¶ and it needs to look great when it appears on your Brand SERP.

Same thing for the description. You need to write a great description that pulls people in and makes them want to watch the video. Once again, you need to use the vocabulary that you set up at the start - YouTube uses the description in its algorithm.

And then you want to add lots of relevant tags. On YouTube, tagging is incredibly important. 

You want to choose the correct category for every single video. It might be the same for all of the videos, but it might also be different. So be very careful about that.

Spend the time to make an attractive custom thumbnail. This is vital to YouTube optimisation since a great thumbnail attracts the eye, gets clicks and therefore views and engagement. But more than that, like the title, the thumbnail is going to be very visible on your Brand SERP‚Ä¶ so make sure it is flattering for you - take the time to make a custom thumbnail for every video, and make it look great.

But YouTube isn‚Äôt the only platform out there -  other platforms can get a place in video boxes‚Ä¶ and pushing video on multiple platforms will help you trigger the video boxes‚Ä¶ even videos on your own sites.

Here‚Äôs an example with Twitter. There‚Äôs two YouTube videos and one Twitter video. Twitter videos are shorter, more to the point, but they do come up a lot. So repurpose your content and push it on Twitter. Make this part of your strategy to trigger Twitter boxes‚Ä¶

If you‚Äôve watched the Twitter Boxes episode, you‚Äôll know that Twitter has a feed directly into Google, so Twitter is a great alternative platform to YouTube for your video content.

Here's an example of somebody who's got all their videos coming from Twitter. Anton doesn't have a YouTube channel, but he‚Äôs very active on Twitter. And that was enough for him to trigger the video boxes!

Facebook comes up, but a lot less often. Perhaps because Facebook simply has too much content and Google can‚Äôt crawl it all. Or perhaps because Facebook don‚Äôt make much effort to optimise their pages for Google. Either way, you can get a place with a video on Facebook, but it‚Äôs less common than YouTube or Twitter.

Any platform that carries video can potentially rank in the video boxes - perhaps Instagram, or Vimeo... but also your own site. SEMrush, have got a video from their own site ranking in the video boxes, and that's even more powerful because they have direct control of the page.

Here's a great example. Once again, it's SEMrush - they have done some good SEO on their pages, and two videos from their website are ranking in the video boxes, right under the homepage. That's a phenomenal amount of control of half the SERP. 

And you‚Äôll notice I said ‚Äògood‚Äô. The SEO on your site doesn‚Äôt need to be spectacularly good to get a place in video boxes -- so add YouTube videos to your website, and spend some time and effort optimising your pages - watch the SEO lesson in the fundamentals course for more on how to do that.

I think we tend to imagine that we need to make all the video content ourselves.
That isn't necessarily true. It depends on your product. It depends on your brand. But here's a great example. Gretsch. They've got partners and distributors making lots of videos for themselves and they are actually ranking on Gretsch‚Äôs Brand SERP.

And here‚Äôs some reviewers, once again, Gretsch guitars.
Send a Vlogger your product, they do a review of it, and that gives a third party independent opinion right on your Brand SERP, which is really powerful. 

The timeframe. 
Your video strategy won‚Äôt trigger video boxes overnight. You need to stick at it. 
Google needs to understand that the videos you've produced really are relevant to your audience if it‚Äôs to give you video boxes. That takes a little time. so the key here is perseverance.
You need to promote and push the videos on the platforms you've chosen - push multiple videos out there, widen your audience, get engagement‚Ä¶ do this week in, week out.  

If you already have great video out there and you push that successfully, triggering video boxes could take only a couple of months .

If you don‚Äôt have great videos, you are looking at 6 months or more.
Making multiple videos might take a couple of months, then getting the traction and engagement on the different channels takes time and effort‚Ä¶ You need to persevere with the promotion and be patient.

Either way, getting the necessary engagement is like a flywheel. It starts off slowly. You seem to go back. Then it starts to go forward and it picks up a bit of speed and once it gets rolling, it just keeps going and keeps going‚Ä¶ 

Then you trigger the video boxes and they look great to your audience, you‚Äôve killed a blue link... and they're on your Brand SERP to stay. Video boxes are pretty stable. Once you trigger them, then tend to stick around.

And lastly, for a bit of encouragement, remember from the example earlier. Video boxes are not just for brands with big budgets - as a smaller brand, with a less ambitious video content strategy, you can trigger to video boxes on your Brand SERP - IF you make truly interesting and helpful content that gets engagement from your audience."
Explanation of Twitter Boxes in the Context of Brand SERPs	"Twitter feeds directly into Google - Twitter Tweets right in Google‚Äôs ear. That means anything that you put on there is injected directly into the brain of Google. 

This Brand SERP is bill dull and boring, right? Twitter boxes make it look much much better. Especially on mobile. Plus, those Twitter boxes take up two places on the SERP‚Ä¶ 
And that means you have control over more real estate. Plus, because it covers more space, often one blue link disappears off the bottom of the page. You have one less element to control, on less piece of content to deal with. 

So, WITH the Twitter boxes up there just below your homepage and rich sitelinks, you‚Äôre covering almost half the SERP. That‚Äôs a lot :)
And there will probably only be five or six blue links underneath. That's going to be much easier to control than the 10 blue links you initially started off with. 

If you have ads, then you will almost certainly be covering everything above the fold on Desktop with content you control directly‚Ä¶ 

Twitter boxes look extra good on mobile if you use images or videos in your Tweets. Here's an example that I tweeted that looks great. I've got an animated GIF, that immediately that attracts the eye. Here‚Äôs one with video content. We're getting some nice multimedia content on the SERP easily and quickly through Twitter. 

So, what you tweet on Twitter is injected directly into Google and is shown on the SERP ‚Ä¶ you have direct control. You control the message. That is a big, big plus.

Even better. Google shows them in real time. Here we've got a Tweet with embedded video that looks great‚Ä¶ and it took 17 seconds from the moment I tweeted it. 

Even better - it changes every time you Tweet. It's fresh content. It‚Äôs your voice in real time. You can communicate up to the minute news, or even snap offers to your audience, including existing customers.

Many of your clients will navigate to your site by searching your brand name in Google‚Ä¶ so some existing clients see this SERP many, many  times, potentially multiple times a day. 
Each time they come back, they see a new Twitter box with fresh new content... and they‚Äôll know that you‚Äôre present , that you're active, and the up full of energy. Plus the SERP stays interesting for them. That‚Äôs all positive for your brand image.

Twitter boxes are the only example I can think of in Google search where you get this advantage and it's on your brands. 

Importantly, Google only shows your Tweets in these boxes on your Brand SERP. 
Nothing anybody tweets about you will appear there. 
Nor will replies to your Tweets. 
Nor will your replies to other Tweets‚Ä¶ 
nor even your retweets. 
It shows only things YOU say, and even then only the initial Tweet you post. That is a lot of control.

What to do to get these Twitter boxes

It‚Äôs quite simple, but quite a lot of work, and you need patience. 
You have to tweet every single day, multiple times per day, whenever possible. You don't have to tweet every hour, unless you really have something useful and helpful to say to your audience that often‚Ä¶ between one and four times a day is fine. 
Beyond that, everything is about engagement. That is what demonstrates to Google that the content is valuable to users searching your brand name. 

Some rules about this ongoing Tweeting
Rule 1 - Retweets aren‚Äôt as valuable as original Tweets. Continue retweeting. But make sure you have a good number of original Tweets.

Rule 2 - Don‚Äôt only talk about yourself. You won‚Äôt be able to generate the user engagement necessary to trigger the Twitter boxes.

You're the star of your own film, but if you talk ONLY about yourself, people aren't going to be interested for very long. Of course, your Twitter account does represent you. You should still tweet about yourself, but not ONLY about yourself. Talk also about others. 
We come back to the idea of empathy for the person with whom you're trying to communicate. Think about what THEY want to hear. What value your Tweets  can bring to them.
That's the way you will trigger the Twitter boxes. And it's also the best way to run a Twitter account. 

Rule 3 - be relevant and useful
You need to bring value to your audience and share things that are of interest to both your existing audience and any wider audience you're trying to reach. Think about their needs, think about what they want. Be empathetic.  Obviously Twitter is a platform where people tweet about lots of different things, so don't always stay 100% on topic since people expect something a little off the beaten path from time to time‚Ä¶ but don't diverge so much that your account loses focus 

Rule 4 - Dialogue. Reply to the replies you get. Think of it as a very short conversation. Anyone reading your Twitter homepage should see a series of relevant conversations between you and your audience.

Rule 5 - Engage back
 ‚ÄúLike‚Äù the replies you get. ‚ÄúLike‚Äù the retweets. Show you are actually interested in the engagement generated by this content you shared.

Rule 6 - Use lots of hashtags. But hashtag wisely. Hashtags push your content out to a wider audience, which is great, but better still to push it out to an audience who will engage with it.  When well chosen, hashtags introduce your brand to a new audience that is pertinent to your business, which is a double win !

Rule 7 - You want to try to attract influencers, especially those who already have Twitter boxes on their personal Brand SERPs. Twitter and Google know they're important, so that‚Äôs a strong signal. 
But stick to people relevant to your market... the more niche, the better. It doesn‚Äôt have to be people with a humongously big following, attract people with smaller followings when they are very relevant.
Don't bully them. You need empathy for people if you want them to react positively to you. Reach out to them by tagging them into something that they will truly be interested in. You need to bring something valuable to them.
If, when they see you've tagged them, they think ‚Äúwow, yes, this IS interesting to me‚Äù, then you‚Äôve got it right. Don‚Äôt reach out or tag an influencer to talk about yourself. 

Think if all this as a flywheel. It takes a lot of work from you to start it turning, then it starts off painfully slowly. You‚Äôll sometimes feel that you're going backwards‚Ä¶ but keep working, and bit by bit, that flywheel will pick up speed and gain some momentum... and you end up with this kind of effect where it just keeps spinning. 
At that point, when you have that momentum, and your Tweets naturally get engagement, there is a nice buzz around your brand and THAT will trigger the Twitter boxes. 

The timeframe is hard to predict.
It depends on where you are starting from. If you already have a nice buzz, it will be very quick... maybe a month or two.
If not, it could be 6 months, it might take a year. But stick with it. 

My example took me six months. I did everything I said on this list. Tweeted every day, reached out to people in my industry, used lots of hashtags, used the like button quite a lot, made sure there was a real dialogue going on‚Ä¶ and I triggered the Twitter boxes after 6 months. 

Initially, if I didn‚Äôt Tweet for one day, the Twitter boxes disappeared. As soon as I Tweeted again, they came back. 
A few months later, they would still be there after two days without a Tweet. Now it is three days.
Over time it appears that the Twitter boxes become more stable. So, once you've triggered your Twitter boxes, you don't have to make so much effort. But then again, once you've got them, it means you're popular. It means people are following you, so you have every interest in pushing that Twitter account more. 

So, with this strategy, you win on Google, and you win on Twitter. Brilliant. 

Once you have those Twitter Bioxes, you don‚Äôt want to lose them.
You‚Äôve done all the really hard work at this point.

You need to continue tweeting every day to stabilise the boxes. After a couple of months you‚Äôll be able to drop to once every two days. Less than that and the account has lost its dynamics, and the boxes may well disappear. 
In my case, over two days, the boxes disappear from the SERP. Then I tweet twice and they come back. That is just one case, but it does indicate that ongoing activity is necessary, but you can take a weekend break from time to time.
However often you Tweet, you need to continue getting engagement. You need to continually prove the people are interested in what you have to say.

In short, best bet is to just continue doing what you were doing in order to trigger the boxes... But what is great is that you won‚Äôt need to work so hard to get the engagement and keep things rolling. Your flywheel is spinning.

Short, mid and long term
 Be Relevant, Be Active, Be Fresh, Be Consistent


Bonuses. 

There are obvious bonuses:
 - your super-dynamic and interesting Twitter account will impress your existing followers
- your activity will also get your brand in front of a wider audience
- it will help you acquire new clients

In addition, there are two bonuses that are specifically brand-SERP related 

We tend to think of YouTube when we think of video boxes. Here's an example where Twitter videos are ranking, and have triggered the video boxes on their own. Please watch the video boxes episode to see how those work. 

Twitter also brings up images, even without the Twitter boxes, your Tweets will show an image if there is one. PLUS they rank well in image search, and potentially in image boxes. 

That‚Äôs two more convincing reasons to use video and images in your Tweets whenever you can. And integrate Twitter into your wider content strategy. For a deeper explanation of that, please watch the episodes about content strategy.

Now, advertising 
Advertising is great right at the start because it helps you gain traction. It gets that flywheel turning. 
I used advertising to kick-start my Twitter account. And it worked a treat for me, but it can be costly, so be a little bit careful. 
I found Twitter to be quite expensive in terms of getting that engagement I needed to get the flywheel going. 
But it definitely helped. But it's not a magic bullet. It's not sustainable. Twitter will never pay if you rely purely on advertising, you need to use that advertising to drive your engagement forward, but the aim has to be to make the account self-sustaining and get that flywheel going, and then you won't need advertising anymore. 

What not to do.
Please do be sure to watch the episode about tactics to avoid and mistakes not to make 

Don't spam influencers. 
Don't tag them in to something that they're not going to be interested in or that doesn't concern them. They will get really annoyed with you really quickly. You would too if someone did that to you.
And remember, Twitter feeds directly into Google. Google will see that they're not interacting with you, that you're reaching out to them and they're not replying. That's a very negative signal. 

Don't buy engagement. 
By that, I don't mean don't advertise. I mean, don't pay click farms to click on your name or to engage with you or buy followers.
Twitter injects directly into Google. Google will find you out sooner or later. You might get away with it today, but you won't get away with it after a while. 
Importantly, if you can get that flywheel going you won't need to cheat. But if you go down the black hat ‚Äúbuying engagement‚Äù path, as soon as you stop, the whole engagement stops and the flywheel stops. Google will see that as well. 

Don‚Äôt build an irrelevant audience

Don't build up a big audience just for the sake of building up a big audience. Build up a big audience because there is a real interest from that audience in what you are saying on Twitter. 
The important thing is not the size of your audience, it's how relevant the audience is and how much they engage with you."
Explanation of People Also Ask in The COntext of Brand SERPs	"Across all its SERPs, Google is pushing People Also Ask very hard. Why? 

When someone searches on Google, they are expressing a problem for which they are looking for a solution, or a question for which they want the answer. Bear in mind that every search is explicitly or implicitly a question or expression of a problem‚Ä¶ Even Googling your brand name‚Ä¶ The implicit question here is ambiguous, but Google understands ‚Äúwhere do I find...‚Äù and ‚ÄúI want information about‚Ä¶‚Äù.

Now, the basic aim of Google is to present the answer to the user‚Äôs question (or solution to their problem). The Brand SERP does this by putting your site at the top for the question ‚Äúwhere do I find...‚Äù, and everything else for the question ‚ÄúI want information about‚Ä¶‚Äù

Today it is moving towards a more proactive role - presenting additional information related to the initial question. Much other platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Amazon and Twitter Google is increasingly keeping the user on their platform by pushing related ideas and suggestions... they‚Äôre expanding the opportunities for the user to stay. 

People Also Ask is one way Google‚Äôs doing this. It‚Äôs suggesting questions that are related to your brand. 
Now, over 30% of Brand SERPs have People Also Ask. If they don't appear on your Brand SERP now, they probably will soon, so it‚Äôs well worthwhile being prepared by making sure that you have the answers to common questions about and around your business - that way you have a great chance of occupying that space when PAA does appear. 

The People Also Ask boxes on Brand SERPs can contain both questions that are specific to the brand and also questions that relate to what the brand does.  Examples of the former are ‚ÄúWho is Woorank‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhere is Woorank based‚Äù, examples of the latter ‚ÄúWhat is SEO site audit?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow can I check my website ranking?‚Äù

For brand-specific questions, you really do need to provide the answer. The questions are specifically about you, and they are right there on your Brand SERP... so you have every interest and every chance to provide the answer yourself. 


Much of the time, these questions are not answered by the brand themselves. They‚Äôre more often answered by third party sites - particularly forums, articles and informational sites like WIkipedia - none of which is controlled by the brand itself.

Dominating the brand-specific questions is simple if you use the FAQ system I‚Äôll show you in a moment. You are the best source of factual information about your brand and products, so logically, you have the best chance of Google providing you here.

For questions that aren‚Äôt brand-specific, ideally you would provide the answer in order to control your SERP, but also to keep the searcher focussed on your brand. Once again, these questions are rarely answered by the brand themselves. They are commonly answered by third party sites such as blogs, articles, informational sites like Wikipedia and, worst of all,  competitors.

Because the industry-level questions can reasonably be answered by anyone, dominating  those questions in the PAA box is harder, but you CAN do it. Once again, the FAQ system in this episode can be a good approach for any questions that have simple answers - say 300 words and less. Questions that require more involved and detailed answers will require a really well SEO‚Äôed article."
Explanation of Why is it so important to control the People Also Ask questions?	"Firstly because you want to control the message on your Brand SERP as much as possible. These PAA boxes give multiple opportunities for you to lose that control. If you don‚Äôt provide the answers to the questions that appear in People Also Ask, you're losing control of YOUR message. You're losing the thread of your own story and letting somebody else tell your story to your audience. 

Secondly, accuracy - the answers that appear might not be correct. That‚Äôs a pity, especially if the question is about your brand or your products.

Thirdly, distraction - these questions can potentially distract people and move them away from focussing on your brand. The questions could start a new train of thought and perhaps move them onto another site - possibly a direct competitor. 

And remember, whoever the person is, this is a critical stage of their relationship with you - they are navigating to your site or researching you... and you really want to keep them 100% focussed on you and the solutions you can bring to them."

How to get the PAA spots for my brand?
For both brand specific and more general question, the single most important thing is to provide a clear, accurate and well-focussed answer to the SPECIFIC question. Then you also need to provide the answers to these questions in a format that is easy for Google to digest, and then deliver to its users on your Brand SERP. 

So you need to make a list of the specific questions that appear on your SERP, then write accurate, well written answers... and put them in an optimised FAQ section. 

In this course we are focussed on Brand SERPs, so the number of questions you need to answer is quite limited. However, you might want to look at building a Q&A strategy - expand this small FAQ section to cover pre and post sales questions both brand-centric and more general.

And that will bring you a big bonus - you‚Äôll cover a wide variety of highly relevant search queries that will get you visibility in Google, and attract traffic. By providing quality answers to relevant questions in a format that is easy to deliver for Google, you‚Äôll appear in a wide variety of SERPs with a good chance of getting People Also Ask and Featured Snippets.

Back to Brand SERPs‚Ä¶

For getting control of your Brand SERP, you need to prioritise the questions that Google is suggesting to its users when they search your name. It doesn't matter if you think these questions are relevant or important. Google thinks they are important and is showing them to your audience. So you need to answer them.

For brand-specific questions, remember that this is information about you that Google is explicitly interested in. It is vital that the information is accurate, and ideally in your own words. 

For questions that are not brand-specific, you can see where you‚Äôre failing. If someone else is ranking in the context of your Brand SERP with a question that Google sees as highly relevant to your brand name, then you have a gap in your content. This is a great opportunity to fill that gap either with a full blown article, or an FAQ page if the question requires only a simple answer."
Explanation of How to Build an FAQ Section on Your Website in the Context of People Also Ask on Your Brand SERP	"Now, the structure of your FAQ section. 
It‚Äôs very important to keep it super-logical so that Google can digest the information easily. If you intend to expand this idea and answer a lot of other questions, then make sure you divide the pages into logical categories so you have a siloed FAQ system that can expand over time.

Your structure will look something like this.
FAQ homepage has a list of the FAQ cat√©gories with links. Each FAQ category has a list of the subcategories with links. Each subcategory has a list of the questions in that category that link through to a page that contains the answer to the specific question.

Importantly, do not put the answer, or even a partial answer, in those category and subcategory pages since Google might be tempted to rank those pages instead of the single answer page that provides the best user experience.

You might be tempted to use an accordion system and provide multiple questions and answers on a single page. Don‚Äôt do that. Why?
1 - it‚Äôs rare that these ranks well
2 - they have much less chance of getting a PAA or featured snippet
3 - the presentation on Google isn‚Äôt great
4 - it‚Äôs a bad user experience when someone comes from Google. 

IF your are lucky enough to rank a page like this and get a click, then this is the situation - The user asked Google a specific question, Google has recommended your answer‚Ä¶ but when they land on your page, they don‚Äôt see the answer. Or even the question! They have to scroll through the questions, scan reading them to find their question, then click on THAT to see the answer. They are unlikely to do that, and likely to bounce.

A better UX is that the user lands on a page that answers the question directly - one Question and Answer per page is good for Google and the user.

So, answer the specific question clearly and accurately‚Ä¶ then provide a list of related questions underneath with links to the pages that answer each. 
That‚Äôs a good user experience - is really great for users to have related questions underneath the initial question so that they can investigate related issues easily. It‚Äôs also great for Google since it helps with crawling and, more importantly, indicates which questions are related to each other... including cross-category.

Breadcrumbs are really useful, so make sure you have them. They are great for giving the user a quick visual clue about the context of the question, and also an opportunity to navigate upwards to other, related questions.

I mentioned that the presentation on Google isn‚Äôt great. 
Here‚Äôs what I mean. I kept it to last because it really is the clincher about the one-page-per-question-and-answer system.
Google shows the meta title as the blue link - so each question needs its own meta title. If you have one page with multiple questions and answers, then the meta title will necessarily be vague and less-than-optimal. 

And Gary Illyes from Google confirmed that for PAA and featured Snippets, they‚Äôre not going to show anything except the meta title as the blue link anytime soon. So this isn't short term. One page per question and answer is the way forward. 

And the last objection I hear is that people who go to the site by another route - directly, or through another referrer, or a bookmark, maybe - won‚Äôt be able to find the answer to their question. Three things here - relatively few people will come to your FAQ and then try to navigate to a specific question. That isn‚Äôt how most people think. If you have search functionality, they might use that ‚Ä¶ but many people instinctively search Google‚Ä¶ and that means they will be better served by a one-page-per-question system.

Now the page layout. 
The H1 is the question, or a statement that represents the question. Like this.
The paragraph immediately below answers the question accurately and clearly - stay focussed on the exact answer to the specific question. 

If the answer requires a couple of paragraphs, that‚Äôs perfect. If the full answer is short, keep it short. If you waffle around the subject, Google will give the People Also Ask spot to someone who doesn‚Äôt. 

Google will show about 50 words on the SERP so the ideal answer takes more than that since, at less than 50 words, the user will have the answer on the SERP, and won‚Äôt need to click. 

On a Brand SERP, that might be acceptable to you - the aim was to get the place in the PAA. In other situations, you really want the click since getting the person to your site allows you to provide more information about your brand and your offers and push towards acquisition with an upsell. 

And importantly, any visit from a new user allows you to add a cookie and potentially remarket them. In the case of Brand SERPs, that‚Äôs particularly valuable - the user is a very valuable target since they just searched for you, so they have demonstrated an interest in working with you. 

Like the H1, the meta title is the question, or a statement that represents the question. Like this.

Then the meta description is a partial answer. As I mentioned, with PAA and Featured Snippets, Google most often displays the paragraph below the H1 that contains the answer, so the meta description doesn‚Äôt offer much control. But it is well worth adding a meta description anyway. Give a partial answer with a call to action - ‚Äúlearn more‚Äù, perhaps. This is going to display when the page appears in other SERPs, perhaps as a traditional blue link.  Like this.

Schema markup
Adding FAQ schema markup to your pages is a VERY good idea. It helps Google digest the content and provides explicit information about how the content should be presented. Both of those encourage Google to deliver your answer in a PAA or Featured Snippet rather than someone else‚Äôs.

Now, there are a couple of big advantages if you are using WordPress, and Yoast 
Yoast makes creating Google-friendly FAQ pages really quick and easy. Yoast offer a super-optimised Gutenberg block with the correct schema markup. Google loves these blocks.

But this changes the layout of the page very slightly. The question needs to go inside the Gutenberg block, so the H1 becomes a short statement that indicates what it is we're talking about. 

So, in this case.
   - H1 is a short statement of context, 
Question and answer should go in the correct places in the Yoast FAQ Gutenberg block. 
The meta title is the question - you‚Äôll need to update that manually since it will default to your H1, which would ruin the trick :), 
the meta description is a full or partial answer as I described before. 

Images
You might have noticed that an image shows in Featured Snippets.
These pages can appear as featured Snippets where images are very important.  If you get a featured snippet with one of these pages, and you don't include an image, Google will either not show an image, or will show an image from another site both of which are lost opportunities for you.

Images don't appear in the People Also Ask box, so for your Brand SERP they aren‚Äôt strictly necessary. But Google may well add images to PAA in the future, so be prepared.

So, if possible, provide a quality image to go with your answer.
Always add it to the same block of content, preferably as an inline image in the paragraph. If you move it outside the block to make things prettier, Google won‚Äôt use your image because it‚Äôs not sure whether or not the answer and the image as belonging together.

Include the image in your Schema markup - that will help Google see the relationship between the answer and the image.

In Yoast for Wordpress, there's an option to add an image to the FAQ Gutenberg block. Use that since it ensures the image is in the same block, and also adds the image to the schema markup. It's easy and very effective, so use it. 

Add video if you can. Yoast handles this too.
Google is looking for more multimedia content, so video gives you a slight advantage today and will probably help enormously going forwards. 
Also, in some circumstances, Google is putting video answers right in the SERP. That‚Äôs an opportunity you‚Äôll want to take. If you don‚Äôt, someone else will. Maybe a competitor. 
Quick hint - since you won‚Äôt get the click, make sure you‚Äôve added some visual branding to the video.

If you‚Äôre not using Wordpress and Yoast, there's a nice Yoast hack. 
Install a copy of WordPress on a development platform - don‚Äôt forget to make it non-indexable‚Ä¶ Install Yoast on that, create Yoast Gutenberg FAQ blocks and copy paste the content block and the schema markup into your live site. 
You could even get your developers to create and integrate a system similar to Yoast‚Äôs FAQ blocks into your CMS.

Quick warning - don‚Äôt oversell in the answer
Whether on your Brand SERP or not, Google is looking to provide a helpful answer to a specific question to its users. So in the answer you give, mention your brand by all means, but don‚Äôt be too sales-centric - heavy-handed sales pitches in informative content is not only a turn-off for Google, but also to people - and on the Brand SERP those people are your core audience.

You don‚Äôt need to oversell - on the answer page you have an opportunity to upsell. In the sidebar or underneath the answer, you can provide more information about your brand, your offers, and a description of why the person might want to do business with you.

Now, how to find the questions that you need to answer
If you have the People Also Ask already on your Brand SERP, you will see three or maybe four questions right there. Add those at the top of your list. Then click on one of those PAA, and another two or three may appear. If they do, then keep clicking on questions until new ones stop appearing. Add all those questions to your list.

If you don‚Äôt have the People Also Ask box on your SERP, or if you want to extend your list of questions, then look at search terms around your brand and see what triggers PAA. Every situation is unique, but here are some examples of queries that often trigger People Also Ask 
‚ÄúWhat is {brand}?‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhat does {brand} do?‚Äù. ‚Äú{brand} info‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhat products does {brand} sell?‚Äù. ‚ÄúHow does {brand} work?‚Äù. ‚Äú{brand} pricing‚Äù. ‚Äú{brand} features‚Äù. 

To find even more questions you can usefully answer, scroll to the bottom and click on the related searches and see if they trigger a People Also Ask. Add those questions to your list too.
After a while, you'll end up seeing the same questions again and again, and that's probably a good time to stop and get to work actually answering the questions :)

You might have 10 questions... or you might have 40. 
Answer at least a dozen. But it‚Äôs a great idea to answer as many as possible for three main reasons 

these are questions your audience ask, so they are good questions to give answers to
your answers will be seen by people on the SERP
Your pages will rank on Google and drive traffic from a qualified audience
it‚Äôs a great opportunity for you to feed Google with information about yourself.

Now, down to the nitty gritty - a quick rundown of what you need to do that this point:
Organise your list of questions into categories and subcategories, write clear, accurate and focussed answers, and add them to your site. The great thing about creating a siloed FAQ section, and having a simple one-page-per-question system is that you can add new pages little by little over time. Maybe start with 6 questions, and add a new page every day for a year. That makes almost 400 great pieces of relevant content that will attract qualified visitors.

How easy is it to win these PAA spots?
It will usually be reasonably easy to get the PAA for questions that are specifically about your brand since Google will often see you as the most authoritative and relevant. For the others, the competition may well be very strong, so winning those places may require some SEO work on your part and you‚Äôll need to be patient. 

What to do if one of your FAQ pages doesn't manage to take the PAA spot: 
Make sure that on your site you answered this question accurately. So check your facts. 
make sure the answer is really focussed. A typical mistake people make is to talk around the subject, which makes the answer less attractive to Google. 
make siure you aren‚Äôt being too commercial - people often make the copy too self-centered and overly salesy. This is a big ‚Äúno‚Äù - it‚Äôs a big turn-off for Google... and for people.

So take a step back, be self-critical and rewrite. Focus. Simplify. Clarify. 

Authority
When choosing which answer to show, Google takes many factors into consideration - some of the most important for PAA are freshness, focus, accuracy and authority. The first three are covered by the work you have already done. 
Authority requires that you demonstrate to Google that your answer is more authoritative than the competing answers. 

How can you demonstrate this?
Add a link to the page from another relevant page on your site
get some inbound links from third party sites

Replacing inaccurate answers about your brand
If an answer about your brand that occupies the PAA is inaccurate, and your answer doesn‚Äôt quickly replace it, work on corroboration to prove to Google that your answer‚Äôs correct. Get other trusted and relevant sources such as influencers, industry sites, Wikipedia and review platforms to repeat your answer‚Ä¶ And then point this corroboration out to Google by linking out to them from your answer. 

Whether the question is specific to you, or more general, imagine you're educating a child. 

Google's a child. It wants to understand, and it wants to get the answers right. Provide it with the answer and then convince it that your answer is accurate and that you are the best source for it to cite by obtaining multiple corroborations from trusted third parties."

Description of Kalicube's Offer for Online Reputation Agencies	"Brand SERPs the key to ORM
Jason Barnard at Kalicube has truly mastered the art and science of managing the online presence of any entity with a new approach to Online Reputation Management that is truly second to none.

If you are responsible for managing the reputation of a person or company and you want to achieive one or more of the following

Push negative content off page #1 of Google SERPs
Rectify incorrect information in Google search results
Improve the Google result when people google the name
Effectively manage the digital footprint
Build a safeguard against firestorms
Deal with reputation firestorms in weeks, rather than months
Ensure you are in control, not Google, Bing, or any other BigTech platform
Then ‚Äúthe Kalicube method‚Äù of ORM is exactly what you have been looking for.
Over more than a quarter of a century working in Digital Marketing, Jason Barnard has developed an incredibly effective and efficient methodology that will empower you to control every aspect of the digital footprint for any person or company by effectively managing:

the Google (or Bing) Knowledge Panel
the Brand SERP
reviews
articles
forums
news (good and bad)
videos
social media
podcasts
books
images and photos
‚Ä¶ and anything else that appears online
Simple Online Reputation Management Anyone Can Manage
Jason has demonstrated that ‚Äì by leveraging the power of Google itself, adding some simple SEO, sprinkling some intelligent marketing and relevant content creation ‚Äì managing the digital footprint of a person or a company is accessible to everyone.

The Old Techniques are Dead
Forget the old techniques of drowning, attacking, court cases and manipulating the system ‚Äì in a world of smart machines, those strategies are now well and truly dead. The strategies that work are those that educate the algorithms that determine how your digital footprint is presented to your audience, be it on Google, Bing, Apple, Facebook or any other online platform.

Educating the Algorithms
At Kalicube, we understand that our job is to share with you the knowledge we have accumulated over a quarter of a century so that you can educate the machines (Google, Bing, Apple, Facebook, Twitter‚Ä¶) so that they represent the entity (person or company) in the manner that makes sense to you.

It is no longer a case of ‚Äúif‚Äù you can gain control of an online presence and reputation, but a case of ‚Äúhow long will it take‚Äù.
This approach is a solution. Simple as that. The techniques and strategies Jason Barnard has developed are based on

a quarter of a century of experience in SEO (getting clients to the top of Google results)
many years managing Google Knowledge Panels for clients
over 10 years optimising Brand SERPs (what your audience sees when they search your name)
vast experience in content creation (videos, TV Series, music albums, songs, script writing, podcasts, articles, visuals, animations‚Ä¶)
experiments designed to uncover how the pieces of an online presence fit together (at Kalicube, we have over 5000 experiments on the go at any one time)
empirical data (Kalicube maintains a massive database with over 500 million datapoints)
All of which adds up to the single most effective approach to managing:

online reputation 
digital footprint 
web presence

Description of Kalicube's Offer for Digital Marketing and Search Engine Optimisation Agencies	"Optimising Brand SERPs and Managing Knowledge Panels. Why?
A Great Brand SERP Tightens up the Bottom of your Acquisition Funnel
When your audience google‚Äôs your name (company or person), they are either navigating to your website (client) or researching you (prospect). What they see is your ‚ÄúGoogle Business Card‚Äù, and that is crucial to both groups of people. A great Brand SERP is ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äôs Stamp of Approval‚Äù and that tightens up the bottom of your acquisition funnel.

Knowledge Panels are Fundamental to your Entity SEO
The Knowledge Panel on the Right Rail of your Brand SERP demonstrates Google‚Äôs explicit understanding of the entity. In the context of Entity SEO, your company is the Cornerstone Entity on which you can easily build understanding of related entities (founders, C-level employees, authors, contributors, products, services etc etc).

If you have built an internal Knowledge Graph using Wordlift, Yoast, SchemaApp or similar, then you need to get that Cornerstone Entity into Google‚Äôs Knowledge Graph. Why? Because you can use that Cornerstone Entity to ‚Äúpiggyback‚Äù the rest of your internal Knowledge Graph into Google‚Äôs Knowledge Graph. Simple.

Being in Google‚Äôs Knowledge Graph is also Vital for Your 2E-A-T.
Google assesses E-E-A-T at three levels: content, author and publisher. Kalicube Pro optimises the author and publisher so that their E-E-A-T is fully leveraged.If Google explicitly understands who the author and publisher of the content is, then it can judge their experience, expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness reliably and can therefore fully apply E-E-A-T signals.
But what if your entity (author or publisher) isn‚Äôt in the Main Knowledge Graph / Vault? If Google hasn‚Äôt explicitly understood, then any E-E-A-T signals it applies in the algorithms are guesswork, less reliable and will therefore have less influence on rankings. 

Why Digital Marketing Agencies Need Kalicube Pro SaaS
How Kalicube Pro Helps Agencies
Kalicube Pro is a SaaS platform that enables ORM, PR and digital marketing agencies to manage the branded presence of companies and people on Google. In Entity SEO, this means you are managing and optimising the Cornerstone Entities.

Overview of Kalicube's Brand SERP and Knowledge Panel Case Studies	"At Kalicube we do a lot of work with clients to help them optimise their Brand SERP and manage their Knowledge Panel. These practical case studies highlight the benefits, the techniques and strategies of different aspects of this work. We start by identifying the problems and challenges that each case has.

These Brand SERP and Knowledge Panel Case Studies case studies include Brand SERP and Knowledge Panel optimisation wins shared with us by people who succeeded on their own after reading Jason Barnard‚Äôs book (The Fundamentals of Brand SERPs for Business), after taking one of the Brand SERP courses in the Kalicube Academy, or by using the Kalicube Pro SaaS Platform.

There are also some case studies from our own experiments at Kalicube ‚Äì we run thousands of experiments every year to develop a toolset of techniques and strategies to take every opportunity offered by Brand SERPs and Knowledge Panels, and also resolve any problem you might encounter with them."
Explanation of the Timeline for Triggering a Knowledge Panel for a Person or a Company	"Explanation of the Timeline for Triggering a Knowledge Panel for a Person or a Company

A Knowledge Panel is Google's stamp of authority for your entity (person or company).

An information-rich, accurate and impressive Knowledge Panel on the Brand SERP Right Rail (facts according to Google).

Protip:

Google is currently most reliable insight into each individual person or company and their digital strategy that Kalicube can leverage to power 10x.

Becoming THE #1 recognised online authority in your niche should be your #1 focus. And the Google search result for your name is the fulcrum today.

Whatever the future, Google, Bing, ChatGPT, Facebook, YouTube ...
all feed from the same source: your own presentation of yourself on the web.

As seen below, the Kalicube Process has helped our clients to trigger, merge, and manage their entities.


The Kalicube Process is simple but geeky. You can get started quickly with this three-step process:

Entity Home: Identify your Entity Home (i.e. the website where the named entity ‚Äúresides‚Äù online),

Corroboration: Get significant corroboration (aka PR campaign),

Signposting: Create an infinite self-confirming loop (by linking from the Entity Home to the corroboration and back).

Learning how to trigger a Knowledge Panel also translates into job offers. Knowledge Panel management continues to be our best-selling service, and our resources have also helped our subscribers build careers.


Where do you learn the Kalicube Process for triggering and managing a Knowledge Panel?

It depends on your learning style. You can look for the articles we publish on the web (Kalicube.com resources), watch tutorials on the Kalicube YouTube channel, use the checklist we provide for free, or enrol in the Kalicube Academy.

However, there are disadvantages that you have to face with the prior options. First, it's difficult to concentrate while watching YouTube videos; second, the long hours spent staring and jumping from article to article.

With the Kalicube process, developed by Jason Barnard, you won't waste your valuable time trying to figure out what to do next. With intermediate to expert SEO experience, you can quickly progress and acquire the skills needed to work on a Knowledge Panel.


Pro-tip: Mistakes in choosing the triggering process can have fatal consequences in the future. Relying on processes that use a pseudo Wikipedia site to trick Google is a pitfall, this will have fatal consequences in the future and cost more to fix.

Why Kalicube Academy?

The course consists of 21 lessons and over 5 hours of video. Unlike many other courses you find online, not a single minute of Kalicube Academy's lessons is ad-libbed.

We script every second of every lesson in the Academy to ensure that every sentence provides valuable insight and not one minute of your time is wasted.

Extremely high production values, focussed content, practical advice, amazing supporting visuals and demonstrative screencasts make all the courses in the Kalicube Academy the ‚ÄúHollywood production‚Äù of online courses :)

While we love the phrase, ‚ÄúWe are building the plane as we fly‚Äù, where we conduct numerous experiments on our own entities, Jason has 15 years of experience in this field already, so you can guarantee that your entity is safe and learning from experienced and capable hands.

So what are you waiting for? Start the Knowledge Panel course, plan and dedicate time for this process, and think about how your authority and credibility will change in the eyes of your audience and your industry when you get ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äôs stamp of approval‚Äù."
What Does Jason Barnard (The Brand SERP Guy) Do and Why Should You Think About Your Brand SERPs?	The Brand SERP Guy (Jason Barnard): Yeah. I started looking at this in 2013 and then started making a serious look at it in 2015. So, I‚Äôve been looking at this for years and talking about it. I think people underestimate greatly the importance of what appears when your audience googles your brand name. It‚Äôs something I think in the SEO circles, you say, well, I rank number one, job done, that‚Äôs it.  The Brand SERP Guy (Jason Barnard): Because SEO traditionally is I want to rank number one to get the traffic, but having your site at number one is the absolute minimum in terms of when somebody searches your brand name. And if you‚Äôre not doing that, you really haven‚Äôt done your job. But then you have to think about the rest of that page. What message does it convey to your audience? Is it positive? Is it accurate? Is it convincing? And the answer 95% of the time is it isn‚Äôt and 99.9% is it could be better.
Your Brand SERP Is Your Google Business Card and a Reflection of Google‚Äôs Opinion of the World‚Äôs Opinion of You	The Brand SERP Guy (Jason Barnard): So, I‚Äôm encouraging brands to take that very seriously and look at it because it‚Äôs your Google business card, let‚Äôs say. All the people searching your brand name are your bottom-of-funnel, post-funnel, client people, prospects, and clients, incredibly important to your business. What they see is phenomenally important.  The Brand SERP Guy (Jason Barnard): But it‚Äôs also a reflection of Google‚Äôs opinion of the world‚Äôs opinion of you. And that‚Äôs a really useful thing to see to understand how Google perceives the world‚Äôs perception of you, as it were, incredibly good insights into what your digital ecosystem looks like.
The Idea of Having Rich Sitelinks on Your Brand SERP for a Better User Experience for Your Audience	Right. The number one thing that most brands or a lot of brands miss is the Rich Sitelinks right underneath the homepage, getting those Rich Sitelinks with the blue link and the description, the little snippets. 55% of brands have them, 45% don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs nuts. And as soon as you see that your brand doesn‚Äôt have them, not only does it show you that your audience is not getting a great user experience.   Because the idea of those Rich Sitelinks is that your audience, who are a subset of Google‚Äôs users, who are searching for your brand name, can then click through to the login page, to the blog page, to the About Us page, to the employment page, whatever it might be. And Google is trying to give them that direct access, so they don‚Äôt have to go through the homepage.   Now, if you don‚Äôt have them, it‚Äôs a sign that Google doesn‚Äôt understand your site properly. And that‚Äôs a fundamental SEO issue. If it hasn‚Äôt understood your site well enough to give you those sitelinks that it really wants to give you if it can, you have a site structure issue. So, what I‚Äôve been doing as well is looking at Brand SERPs to analyse major SEO issues like that. That‚Äôs just one example.
Who is Jason Barnard	The Brand SERP Guy Jason Barnard is an international digital marketing consultant who specialises in Brand SERPs. He also teaches Brand SERP optimisation to students at Kalicube Academy. He writes regularly for leading digital marketing publications such as Search Engine Journal and SEMrush and regularly features in others such as onCrawl, Search Engine Watch, Searchmetrics, Trustpilot and Content King. Jason frequently speaks at major marketing conferences worldwide including BrightonSEO, PubCon, SMX London and Munich, ITB Berlin and YoastCon. Jason has over 2 decades of experience in digital marketing, he started promoting his first website in the year Google was incorporated and built it up to become one of the top 10,000 most visited sites in the world (60 million visits in 2007). You might want to check out Jason's digital marketing podcast. The conversations are always intelligent, interesting and fun. Guests include Rand Fishkin, Joost de Valk, Jono Alderson, Bill Slawski, John Mueller... Just search "Jason Barnard podcast" on Google
The Importance of Having a Good Twitter Strategy and Video Strategy to Trigger Twitter Boxes and Video Boxes on Your Brand SERP	Another one that I love is just below that, you would tend to get Twitter boxes. If you‚Äôre tweeting like mad and you don‚Äôt have Twitter boxes on your Brand SERP, it means that Google doesn‚Äôt see that your audience is engaging. It doesn‚Äôt see them as valuable, because what it presents on your Brand SERP is what it thinks is going to be valuable, helpful to your audience. So if you are tweeting and you don‚Äôt have the Twitter boxes, it means that Google doesn‚Äôt see that as being valuable and helpful to your audience, which implies that your Twitter strategy is misfiring.   Then you can look at video boxes. Once again, if you‚Äôre investing in video but Google isn‚Äôt showing that video on your Brand SERP, it implies that Google doesn‚Äôt see them as being important, helpful, and valuable to your audience, which means either the videos are not very good or Google is simply not seeing that engagement. It doesn‚Äôt understand that your audience are actually using and enjoying these videos.   So, either way, either you need to boost up your video strategy or think about how your users are engaging, on what platforms, is it truly relevant. So, all of these are great insights into what you are doing right and wrong in your content strategy in the wider sense.
According to Jason Barnard (The Brand SERP Guy), Start Building Your Digital Strategy From the Brand SERP Outwards	I‚Äôm increasingly saying, and I like your analysis of it or your way of stating it, but what I‚Äôm saying to people is start building your digital strategy from the Brand SERP outwards. Look at your Brand SERP and say, what do I see? What did I expect to see? Usually, it‚Äôs not the same thing. What do I want to see?   And when you think that through, a) first of all, you start to understand your audience. Because you say, what do I want to see? But actually, what do my audience need to see? What would be helpful to my audience? And that immediately gets you looking, not in such a self-centred manner. I was saying it in French. I do apologise.   Which is looking at your own belly button. Yeah. If you‚Äôre obsessed by yourself, you‚Äôre looking at your own belly button. And so, it forces you to take that alternative perspective, the perspective of your audience, which is the one you should be having anyway.
By Analysing Your Content Strategy, Your Brand SERP Will Give You an Overview About How Well Google Understands Your Brand	"And then the Brand SERP also allows you to analyse very quickly what‚Äôs right and what‚Äôs wrong with your content strategy, but also with your ecosystem more generally. For example, if a relatively negative review site is ranking quite high, ask yourself why that one‚Äôs ranking, when the one that you‚Äôre really working on pushing those great reviews to isn‚Äôt ranking. You‚Äôre maybe focusing on the wrong review platforms.   So, your Brand SERP gives you this incredible overview of how well Google understands who you are, what you do, and who your audience is, gives you an overview of what Google thinks your audience wants to see, gives you an overview of how good or bad your content strategy is, vertical by vertical, and it gives you an overview of your ecosystem and your online reputation, which then feeds through into E-A-T and then you open a big bag kettle of fish.

If people aren‚Äôt looking at their Brand SERPs, they are missing a very, very big chunk of their digital strategy and an opportunity to improve it.   From my perspective, I started looking at Brand SERPs in 2015. I thought this will take me a couple of months, like most people do, I think. I can sort this out, no problem at all. Six and a half years later, I‚Äôm still digging down. And every day, I find something new. Every day, I find something I didn‚Äôt see previously. And every day, I find something that helps me as a marketer. So, I honestly think if people aren‚Äôt looking at their Brand SERPs, they are missing a very, very big chunk of their digital strategy and an opportunity to improve it."
When Tracking Your Brand Plus Its Reviews, Don‚Äôt Just Focus on the First Page Because a Deeper Analysis Will Be Revealed on the Next Pages	"Brand reviews is something I do track and I do look at. But in fact, those review platforms will be in your Brand SERP. They‚Äôll just be down on page 5 or 6 a lot of the times. So in fact, you can just look at them. So I do advise companies: Don‚Äôt just focus on that first page. 

Because if you look on page 2, page 3, page 4, page 5, page 6, you see a really deep analysis of your content strategy, your digital ecosystem, and your reputation in Google‚Äôs eyes. So, I would advise you to look at brand reviews."

Has the Google Knowledge Panel Made Your Personal Website Obsolete?	"You care about your online reputation, so you did what every diligent entrepreneur has done: You created a personal website. But just like LinkedIn made business cards obsolete, a powerful feature from Google could soon do the same for your personal website.

Meet the Google Knowledge Panel. Compiled by Google‚Äôs proprietary algorithm, this robust infobox displays the most relevant, credible information about a topic next to its search results. These topics can be places or businesses ‚Äî or even entrepreneurs like you and me. If you claim and own your knowledge panel, it‚Äôs akin to owning personal real estate on Google Search Results.  

As someone who claimed my Google Knowledge Panel, lost it to another Scott Duffy, then reclaimed and optimized it, I can attest to the instant impact it provides when my audience Googles me. For Jason Barnard, founder and CEO of Kalicube, the panel‚Äôs value lies in its combination of visibility, credibility and control.

‚ÄúWhen you introduce yourself to someone, the first thing they‚Äôll do is Google you,‚Äù Barnard says. ‚ÄúWith the right approach to your Google Knowledge Panel, you can control how your brand is displayed online by the most credible online source: Google.‚Äù

Want to take control of your brand narrative online? Then it‚Äôs time to make the Google Knowledge Panel ‚Äî not your personal website ‚Äî the hub of your digital presence. If you invest in one brand-building effort in 2023, make it this."
Building Credibility online with a Personal websites and Wikipedia pages	"Regarded as the leading authority on the Google Knowledge Panel, Barnard started his digital career the same year that Google was incorporated. (That‚Äôs 1998, in case you‚Äôre wondering.) In the decades since, he has witnessed many evolutions in how we represent ourselves online. From personal websites to Wikipedia, all roads lead to the Google Knowledge Panel.

In the late 1990s, personal websites were reserved mostly for geeks and techies, Barnard says. This trend persisted even with the launch of WordPress in 2003. At the time, WordPress was a blogging site, and it lacked the easy web-building tools it‚Äôs known for today. People were more likely to represent themselves online via Myspace, which launched in the same year. (By 2006, Myspace was the most visited website in the U.S. ‚Äî outranking both Google and Yahoo! Mail.)

Myspace may have lost the social media wars, but WordPress now powers nearly 40% of all websites. The popularity of personal websites has boomed right along with the platform. By 2010, Barnard says, most people who cared about their reputation online had already launched a personal website using WordPress, Squarespace or another similar tool. 

The personal website has long been touted as the key to a strong online brand. Since 2010, Entrepreneur has published hundreds of articles about the value of personal websites. A quick Google search for the term shows the extent to which platforms like WordPress and Squarespace are vying for a piece of this sizable pie. But although a personal website can be an important tool, it typically lacks credibility. And in today‚Äôs noisy Internet landscape, credibility matters more than ever, Barnard says.

Since its launch two decades ago, Wikipedia has been the primary tool for building credibility online. But between its editorial system and internal politics, Wikipedia is a risky game that only a few people control, according to Barnard. 

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre famous enough to get a Wikipedia page, it will bring you credibility. But if a person isn‚Äôt sufficiently notable, they don‚Äôt get a place on Wikipedia,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúMost CEOs of most companies wouldn‚Äôt get one.‚Äù"
The rise of the Google Knowledge Panel as Source of Truth	"When Google launched its knowledge panel in 2012, you had to have a Wikipedia page to get one. Google would simply pull information from Wikipedia and present it in an infobox that appeared to the right of a person‚Äôs search results on desktop. But behind the scenes, the search giant had already identified Wikipedia‚Äôs limitations. 

‚ÄúWikipedia contains 50 million articles, and that might seem like a lot,‚Äù Barnard says. ‚ÄúBut when you consider there are 6 billion people on Earth and, let‚Äôs say, 7 billion companies, you end up with this immense amount of data that could never be in Wikipedia.‚Äù

Google‚Äôs solution? Its own machine-readable version of Wikipedia called the Google Knowledge Graph. This graph finds information on the web, uses algorithms to separate fact from fiction, and adds the factual information to your Google Knowledge Panel. The result is a powerful tool that gives you the best of both worlds: All the brand control you have on your personal website, plus the kind of instant credibility that was once reserved for people lucky enough to get Wikipedia pages.

‚ÄúRight now, Google‚Äôs Knowledge Graph contains 150 billion facts,‚Äù Barnard says, ‚ÄúSuddenly, Wikipedia seems very small.‚Äù"
Take control of your Google Knowledge Panel	"Think of your Google Knowledge Panel as your website on Google. If you optimize it properly, people will be able to find everything they need to gauge your credibility without ever having to go to your personal website. Barnard frames it like this: On your personal website, you say something about yourself. On your Google Knowledge Panel, Google says it‚Äôs fact. 

The more you optimize your knowledge panel, the more dynamic it will become. And at every stage, you‚Äôre in control, Barnard says. With the right strategy, you can equip your panel with ‚Äúfilter pills,‚Äù or tabs that provide quick reference points for things like your name, company, books and social media ‚Äî almost like the navigation of your mini Google website. 
 
‚ÄúYour filter pill colors are based on the primary color in the photos that come up when people search you,‚Äù Barnard says. ‚ÄúSo you can influence that, too.‚Äù

How do you get a Google Knowledge Panel? Wikipedia is still one way. But the most effective way, Barnards says, is by educating the algorithm about who you are, what you do and what audience you serve. That strategy doesn‚Äôt require Wikipedia at all."
How to Start Managing Your Google Knowledge Panel Right Now	"‚ÄúIf you educate the algorithm proactively, you can control the information in that knowledge panel,‚Äù Barnard says. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt do this proactively, Google will probably figure out the facts about you, but more likely than not it‚Äôs going to get them wrong.‚Äù

If you‚Äôre ready to boost your online brand with the Google Knowledge Panel, start with these three steps.
Create a personal website (if you don‚Äôt have one already)
When properly optimized, the Google Knowledge Panel can provide the kind of ‚Äúat a glance‚Äù credibility that‚Äôs impossible to achieve on your personal website. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you should do away with your site altogether. 

‚ÄúYour website is no longer the primary destination,‚Äù says Barnard. ‚ÄúInstead, it‚Äôs a tool that feeds information to Google to build credibility for your knowledge panel.‚Äù

Barnard, whose firm develops websites that bolster your Google Knowledge Panel, says to consider a single page ‚Äî not 50. Start by drafting a bio that clearly states who you are and what audience you serve. Use the photos that you want to appear in your Google Knowledge Panel. Then, indicate all the corroborative sources that prove what you‚Äôre saying is true, whether it‚Äôs CrunchBase, IMDB or even your company website, Barnard says.

Your website should accomplish two tasks: Establish the narrative you want on your Google Knowledge Panel and provide Google‚Äôs algorithm with all the sources it needs to verify your information.  
Do a spring cleaning around the web 
Now that you‚Äôve created a one-page website, make sure the information there is consistent with what you‚Äôve posted across the web. If you use 20 different cover photos and bios, Google‚Äôs algorithm gets confused. The result? Less control over what appears on your knowledge panel. 

Find all the references to your name online. Then, make sure your bio and image are the same on all of them. The copy should match what‚Äôs on your website and be what you want to appear on your Google Knowledge Panel.

With more web 2.0 profiles and media sites than ever before, finding every reference will take more digging than you realize. Barnard has built a SaaS platform that automates the process of finding and updating references ‚Äî putting entrepreneurs on a fast track to a strong Google Knowledge Panel.  
Create links from your website to each corroborative source (and vice versa)
Building a Google Knowledge Panel is all about feeding the algorithm the information it wants, and robots learn by repetition. After you‚Äôve created links from your website to each credible source, link those sources back to your website. This creates a loop of self-corroboration that Google‚Äôs algorithm loves."
Claim your Google knowledge panel if you can	"Some knowledge panels are claimable and some aren‚Äôt. (If yours is claimable, you‚Äôll see a button that says ‚ÄúClaim This Knowledge Panel.‚Äù) Although it might be tempting, make sure you complete the three steps above before you claim your Google Knowledge Panel. By following these steps in order, you can actively frame your narrative before Google associates it with your brand online.

If you see something amiss on your Google Knowledge Panel, you can also send feedback directly to Google employees. However, only suggest a change that‚Äôs factual in nature; they‚Äôre unlikely to change your main image simply because you don‚Äôt like how you look, Barnard says. 

With the recession looming, entrepreneurs are being more strategic than ever about where to spend their time and energy in the New Year. If you invest in one brand-building tactic, make it your Google Knowledge Panel. By doing so, you can control how your brand is displayed online by the world‚Äôs most credible source."
